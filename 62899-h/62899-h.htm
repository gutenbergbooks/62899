<small>THE FIGHT ON THE MOOR</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a gorge of the moors, not far away as the crow flies from
Pendle Hill, stood a grim, rambling house known to the heath-men
as Windyhough. It had been fortified once; but afterwards,
in times of ease, successive owners had thought more of
dice and hunting than of warfare, and within-doors the house
was furnished with a comfort that belied its loopholed walls.</p>

<p>It stood in the county of Lancaster, famed for its loyalty
and for the beauty of its women&mdash;two qualities that often run
together&mdash;and there had been Royds at Windyhough since
Norman William first parcelled out the County Palatine among
the strong men of his following. The Royd pride had been
deep enough, yet chivalrous and warm-hearted, as of men
whose history is an open book, not fearing scrutiny but asking
it.</p>

<p>The heir of it all&mdash;house, and name, and lusty pride&mdash;came
swinging over the moor-crest that gave him a sight of Windyhough,
lying far below in the haze of the November afternoon.
It was not Rupert&#8217;s fault that he was the heir, and less
strong of body than others of his race. It was not his fault
that Lady Royd, his mother, had despised him from infancy,
because he broke the tradition of his house that all its sons
must needs be strong and good to look at.</p>

<p>The heir stood on the windy summit, his gun under his
arm, and looked over the rolling, never-ending sweep of hills.
The sun, big and ruddy, was dipping over Pendle&#8217;s rounded
slope, and all the hollows in between were luminous and still.
He forgot his loneliness&mdash;forgot that he could not sit a horse
with ease or pleasure to himself; forgot that he was shy of
his equals, shy of the country-folk who met him on the road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
that his one respite from the burden of the day was to get up
into the hills which God had set there for a sanctuary.</p>

<p>Very still, and straight to his full height, this man of five-and-twenty
stood watching the pageant of the sun&#8217;s down-going.
It was home and liberty to him, this rough land where
all was peat and heather, and the running cry of streams
afraid of loneliness, and overhead the snow-clouds thrusting
forward from the east across the western splendour of blue,
and red, and sapphire.</p>

<p>He shivered suddenly. As of old, his soul was bigger than
the strength of his lean body, and he looked down at Windyhough
with misgiving, for he was spent with hunger and long
walking over the hills he loved. He thought of his father,
kind always and tolerant of his heir&#8217;s infirmities; of his mother,
colder than winter on the hills; of Maurice, his younger
brother by three years, who could ride well, could show
prowess in field-sports, and in all things carry himself like
the true heir of Windyhough.</p>

<p>A quick, unreasoning hatred of Maurice took him unawares&mdash;Esau&#8217;s
hate for the supplanter. He remembered that Maurice
had never known the fears that bodily weakness brings.
In nursery days he had been the leader, claiming the toys he
coveted; in boyhood he had been the friend and intimate of
older men, who laughed at his straightforward fearlessness,
and told each other, while the heir stood by and listened, that
Maurice was a pup of the old breed.</p>

<p>There was comfort blowing down the wind to Rupert, had
he guessed it. The moor loves her own, as human mothers
do, and in her winter-time she meant to prove him. He did
not guess as much, as he looked down on the huddled chimney-stacks
of Windyhough, and saw the grey smoke flying
wide above the gables. His heart was there, down yonder
where the old house laughed slyly to know that he was heir
to it, instead of Maurice. If only he could take his full share
in field-sports, and meet his fellows with the frank laugh of
comradeship&mdash;if he had been less sensitive to ridicule, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
self-distrust inbred in him by Lady Royd&#8217;s disdain&mdash;his world
might have worn a different face to-day. He stooped to pat
the setter that had shared a day&#8217;s poor sport with him, and
then again his thoughts went roving down the years.</p>

<p>He did not hear the sound of hoofs behind him, till Roger
Demaine&#8217;s daughter rode close up, reined in, and sat regarding
him with an odd look of pity, and liking, and reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look out of heart, Rupert. What ails you?&#8221; she
asked, startling him out of his day-dream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Life. It is life that ails me,&#8221; he muttered, then laughed
as if ashamed of his quick outburst. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been tramping the
moors since daybreak, Nance,&#8221; he went on, in a matter-of-fact
voice, &#8220;and all for three brace of grouse. You know how
much powder goes to every bird I kill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Rupert, why are you so bitter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m your fool,&#8221; he broke in, with easy irony.
&#8220;Oh, they think I do not know! They call me the scholar&mdash;or
the dreamer&mdash;or any other name&mdash;but we know what they
mean, Nance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s face was grave and puzzled. Through all the
years they had known each other, he and she, he had seldom
shown her a glimpse of this passionate rebellion against the
world that hemmed him in. And it was true&mdash;pitiably true.
She had seen men smile good-naturedly when his name was
spoken&mdash;good-naturedly, because all men liked him in some
affectionate, unquestioning way&mdash;had heard them ask each
other what the Royds had done in times past to deserve such
ill-luck as this heir, who was fit only for the cloisters where
scholars walked apart and read old tomes.</p>

<p>And yet, for some odd reason, she liked him better for the
outburst. Here on his own moors, with the tiredness in his
face and the ring of courage in his voice, she saw the manhood
in him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rupert,&#8221; she said, glancing backward, and laughing to hide
her stress of feeling. &#8220;You&#8217;ve lost me a race to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; he said, yielding still to his evil humour. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
was always in the way, Nance. My lady mother told me as
much, no longer ago than yesterday. This race of yours?&#8221;
he added, tired of himself, tired of the comrade moor, weary
even of Nance Demaine, who was his first love and who would
likely, if he died in his bed at ninety, be his last.</p>

<p>She glanced over her shoulder again, and saw two horsemen
cantering half a mile away through the crimson sunset-glow.
&#8220;It was a good wager, Rupert, and you&#8217;ve spoilt it. The hunt
was all amiss to-day&mdash;whenever we found a fox, we lost him
after a mile or two&mdash;and Will Underwood and your brother,
as we rode home&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother, and Will Underwood&mdash;yes. They hunt in
couples always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be patient, Rupert! Your temper is on edge. I&#8217;ve never
known it fail you until to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fools are not supposed to show temper,&#8221; he put in dryly.
&#8220;It is only wise men who&#8217;re allowed to ride their humours on
a loose rein. So you had a wager, Nance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. We had had no real gallop; so, coming home,
Maurice said that he would give me a fair start&mdash;as far
as Intake Farm&mdash;and the first home to father&#8217;s house
should&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She halted, ashamed, somehow, of Rupert&#8217;s steady glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the wager?&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced behind her. The two horsemen were climbing
Lone Man&#8217;s Hill, and the sight of them, just showing over
the red, sunset top, gave her new courage. &#8220;You&#8217;re brave,
Rupert, and I was full of laughter till you spoiled my ride.
It was so slight a wager. Maurice has a rough-haired terrier
I covet. If&mdash;Rupert, you look as if I were a sinner absolute&mdash;if
I were first home, Maurice was to give me the dog&mdash;and,
if not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if not?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was dismayed by his cold air of question. &#8220;If I lost
the wager? Your brother was to have my glove. What
harm was there? He&#8217;s a boy, Rupert&mdash;besides,&#8221; she added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
with the unheeding coquetry that was constantly leading her
astray, &#8220;it is you who make me lose the wager. See them,
how close they are! And I&#8217;d kept my lead so splendidly
until you checked me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was not heeding her. His eyes were fixed on the upcoming
horsemen, and Nance could not understand this new,
tense mood of his. It was only when Will Underwood and
young Maurice reined up beside them that she knew there
was trouble brewing, as surely as snow was coming with the
rising wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve caught you, Nance,&#8221; laughed Maurice. &#8220;Will you
settle the wager now, or later?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was big and buoyant, this lad of two-and-twenty. Life
had used him well, had given him a hale body, and nerves
like whipcord, and a good temper that needed little discipline
to train it into shape.</p>

<p>Will Underwood laughed. &#8220;Best hasten, Maurice, or I&#8217;ll
claim the forfeit for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert glanced from Will Underwood to Maurice. There
was no hurry in his glance, only a wish to strike, and a temperate,
quiet question as to which enemy he should choose.
Then, suddenly, the indignities of years gone by came to a
head. He recalled the constant yielding to his brother, the
gibes he had let pass without retaliation, the long tale of renunciation,
weakness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maurice,&#8221; he said, with a straightening of his shoulders,
&#8220;I want a word with you. Mr. Underwood, you will ride
home with Nance? We shall not need you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will Underwood gave a smothered laugh, but Nance was
grave. She looked first at Maurice&#8217;s boyish, puzzled face,
then at Rupert.</p>

<p>&#8220;I claim your escort, Mr. Underwood,&#8221; she said sharply.</p>

<p>Some reproof in her tone ruffled Will Underwood and kept
him silent as they rode over the crest of the moor and down
the long, rough slopes that led them to the pastures. He was
assured of his reputation as a hard rider and a man of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
world; and it piqued him to be given marching orders by a
boy of five-and-twenty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rupert thought himself his own father just now, Miss
Demaine,&#8221; he said in his deep, pleasant voice. &#8220;For the first
time since I&#8217;ve known him, he had something of the grand
air. What mischief are the two lads getting into up yonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance did not know her own mood. She seemed to be free,
for the moment, of her light-hearted, healthy girlhood, seemed
to be looking, old and wise, into some muddled picture of the
days to come. &#8220;No mischief,&#8221; she answered, as if some other
than herself were speaking. &#8220;Rupert is finding his road to
the grand air, as you call it. It is a steep road, I fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up on the moor Maurice was facing his elder brother.
&#8220;What fool&#8217;s play is this, Rupert?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you hunt instead of prowling up and down the moor with a
gun till your wits are addled? Your face is like a hatchet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You made a wager?&#8221; said Rupert, with the same desperate
quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;ve won it. Come, old monk, admit there are
worse gloves to claim in Lancashire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert winced. His thoughts of Nance Demaine were so
long, so fragrant. Since his boyhood struggled first into the
riper understanding, he had cloistered her image from the
world&#8217;s rough usage. She had been to him something magical,
unattainable, and he was paying now for an homage less
healthy than this world&#8217;s needs demand. It was all so trifling,
this happy-go-lucky wager of a dog against a glove; but
he saw in it a supplanting more bitter than any that had gone
before.</p>

<p>He stood there for a moment, irresolute, bound by old subservience
to Maurice, by remembrance of his weakness and his
nickname of &#8220;the scholar.&#8221; Then the moor whispered in his
ear, told him to be a fool no longer; and a strength that was
almost gaiety came to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of the saddle, Maurice,&#8221; he said peremptorily. &#8220;I
want to talk to you on foot.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>Maurice obeyed by instinct, as if a ghost had met him in
the open and startled him. Here was the scholar&mdash;the brother
whom he could not any way despise, because he loved him&mdash;with
a red spot of colour in each cheek, and in his voice
the ring of true metal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked the younger.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never would have claimed that glove.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s temper, easy-going as it was, was roused.
&#8220;Would <i>you</i> have hindered me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I&mdash;I love her. That is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>So young Maurice laughed aloud, and Rupert ran in suddenly
and hit him on the mouth, and the fight began. In his
dreams the heir of Windyhough had revelled in battles, in
swift assaults, forlorn and desperate hopes; for he had known
no waking pleasures of the kind. And always, in his dreams,
there had been a certain spaciousness and leisure; he had found
time, in between giving and receiving blows, to feel himself
the big man of his hands, to revel in the sheer bravery of the
thing.</p>

<p>In practice, here on the open moor, with snow coming up
across the stormy, steel-grey sky, there was no leisure and no
illusion. He had no time to feel, no luxury of sentiment.
He knew only that, in some muddled way, he was fighting
Nance&#8217;s battle; that, by some miracle, he got a sharp blow
home at times; that twice Maurice knocked him down; that,
by some native stubbornness, he got up again, with the moor
dancing in wide circles round him, and hit his man.</p>

<p>It was swift and soon over, as Rupert thought of this battle
afterwards. No pipes were playing up and down the hills, to
hearten him. Even the wind, whose note he loved, blew swift
from the east about deaf ears. He and his brother were
alone, in a turmoil of their own making, and his weakening
arms were beating like a flail about the head of Maurice, the
supplanter. Then the moors whirled round him, a world big
with portent and disaster; and dimly, as from a long way off,
he heard Maurice&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to kill him before he gives in. Who ever thought
it of the scholar?&#8221;</p>

<p>The gibe heartened Rupert. He struggled up again, and
by sheer instinct&mdash;skill he had little, and strength seemed to
have left him long ago&mdash;he got another swift blow home.
And then darkness settled on him, and he dreamed again of
battle as he had known it in the fanciful days of boyhood.
He revelled in this lonely moorland fight, counted again each
blow and wondered at its strength, knew himself at last a proven
man. His dreams were kind to him.</p>

<p>Then he got out from his sickness, little by little, and looked
about him, and saw a half-moon shining dimly through a
whirl of snow. The east wind was playing shrewdly round
his battered face, as if a man were rubbing salt into his
wounds. He tried to get up, looked about him again, and saw
Maurice stooping over him.</p>

<p>A long glance passed between the brothers, Rupert lying on
the heather, Maurice kneeling in the sleety moonlight. There
was question in the glance, old affection, some trouble of the
jealousy that had bidden them fight just now. Then a little
sob, of which he was ashamed, escaped the younger brother.</p>

<p>Rupert struggled to a sitting posture. He could do no more
as yet. &#8220;So I&#8217;m not just the scholar?&#8221; he asked feebly.</p>

<p>Maurice, young as he was, was troubled by the vehemence,
the wistfulness, of the appeal. Odd chords were stirred, under
the rough-and-ready view he had of life. This brother with
whom he had fought just now&mdash;he understood, in a dim way,
the pity and the isolation of his life, understood the daily suffering
he had undergone. Then, suddenly and as if to seek
relief from too much feeling, the younger brother laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next time a man sneers at you for being a scholar,
Rupert, give him a straight answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; The heir of Windyhough was dazed and muddled
still, though he had got to his feet again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit him once between the eyes. A liar seldom asks a
second blow, so father says.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Then a silence fell between them, while the last of the sunset
red grew pale about the swarthy line of heath above
them, and the moon sailed dim and phantom-like through the
sleety clouds. They had been fond of each other always, but
now some deeper love, some intimate communion, gathered
the years up and bound them into lasting friendship. Maurice
had been jealous of his brother&#8217;s heirship, contemptuous of his
scholarship. And Rupert had been sick at heart, these years
past, knowing how well the supplanter sat his horse, and carried
a gun, and did all things reckoned worthy.</p>

<p>And now they met on equal terms. They had fought together,
man against man; and their love ripened under the
bitter east wind and the stinging sleet, as the man&#8217;s way is.</p>

<p>They went down the moor together, Maurice leading his
horse by the bridle. They were no heroic figures, the three
of them. The horse was shivering, after long waiting in the
cold while his master settled private differences; and the two
brothers limped and stumbled as they picked their way down
the white slope of the moor. There was no speed of action
now; there was, instead, this slow march home that in its very
forlornness touched some subtle note of humour. Yet Rupert
was warm, as if he sat by a peat-fire; for he felt a man&#8217;s soul
stirring in him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did we fight about?&#8221; asked Maurice suddenly.
&#8220;The fun was so hot while it lasted&mdash;and, gad, Rupert, I&#8217;ve
forgotten what the quarrel was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the elder brother grew quick, alert. It seemed he
was ready to provoke a second fight. &#8220;It was Nance&#8217;s
glove,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;You said you meant to claim it, and
I said not. I say it still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, old lad!&#8221; laughed Maurice, patting him
lightly on the shoulder. &#8220;You shall have the glove. She&#8217;d
rather give it to you than to any man in Lancashire. I said
as much to Will Underwood just now, and he didn&#8217;t relish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather give it me?&#8221; echoed the other, with entire simplicity.
&#8220;I can do nothing that a woman asks, Maurice.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>A sudden dizziness crossed his eagerness. He could not
keep the path, until Maurice steadied him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can hit devilish hard,&#8221; said the younger dryly.</p>

<p>The three of them went down the moor, counting the furlongs
miles. And again the brothers met on equal terms; for
each was bruised and hungry, and body-sickness, if it strike
deep enough, is apt to bring wayfarers to one common level.</p>

<p>Nance and Will Underwood had reached the lower lands
by now, and she turned to him at the gate of Demaine House
with some reluctance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will let my father thank you for your escort?&#8221; she
asked, stroking her mare&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come in,&#8221; he answered, with the rollicking assurance
that endeared him to the hard riders of the county&mdash;&#8220;if only
for an hour more with you.&#8221; He leaned across and touched
her bridle-hand. &#8220;Nance, you&#8217;ve treated me all amiss these
last days. You never give me a word apart, and there&#8217;s so
much&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired and cold,&#8221; she broke in, wayward and sleety as
this moorland that had cradled her. &#8220;You may spare me&mdash;what
shall I say?&mdash;the flattery that Mr. Underwood gives every
woman, when other women are not there to hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not know what ailed her. Until an hour ago she
had been yielding, little by little, to the suit which Will Underwood
had pressed on her&mdash;in season and out, as his way was.
There had been sudden withdrawals, gusts of coquetry, on her
part; for the woman&#8217;s flight at all times is like a snipe&#8217;s&mdash;zig-zag,
and only to be reckoned with according to the rule of
contraries.</p>

<p>But now, as she went into the house, not asking but simply
permitting him to follow her, there was a real avoidance of
him. She could not rid herself of the picture of Rupert,
standing desolate up yonder on the empty moors&mdash;Rupert,
who was heir to traditions of hard riding and hard fighting;
Rupert, with the eyes of a dreamer and the behaviour of a
hermit. She wondered what he and Maurice were doing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the moor. His last words had not suggested need of her&mdash;had
hinted plainly that he had a man&#8217;s work to do.</p>

<p>Her father was in the hall as they came in. A glance at his
face told her that Roger Demaine was in no mood for trifles,
and she stood apart, willingly enough, while he gravely offered
wine to Underwood, and filled his glass for him, and scarcely
paused to let him set lips to it before he ran into the middle
of his tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s muddled news from Scotland. I can&#8217;t make head
or tail of it,&#8221; he said, glancing sharply round to see that no
servants were in earshot. &#8220;We expected him to come south
with the New Year, and I&#8217;ve had word just now that he&#8217;ll be
riding through Lancashire before the month is out&mdash;that he
means to keep Christmas in high state in London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not believe it,&#8221; said Will Underwood lazily. &#8220;The
clans up yonder need more than a week or two to rally to the
muster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were always slow to believe,&#8221; snapped the Squire.
&#8220;Have a care, Will, or they&#8217;ll say you&#8217;re like nine men out of
ten&mdash;loyal only until the test comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other glanced at Nance, then at his host. &#8220;I would not
permit the insult from a younger man, sir,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, fiddle-de-dee!&#8221; broke in old Roger. &#8220;Fine phrases
don&#8217;t win battles, and never did. Insult? None intended,
Will. But I&#8217;m sick with anxiety, and you younger men are
the devil and all when you&#8217;re asked to ride on some one else&#8217;s
errand than your own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roger Demaine, big of height and girth, his face a fine, fox-hunter&#8217;s
red, stood palpably for the old race of squires. In his
life there were mistakes enough&mdash;mistakes of impulse and of
an uncurbed temper&mdash;but there was no pandering to shame of
any sort.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I&#8217;m asked, sir, I shall answer,&#8221; said Will Underwood,
moving restlessly from foot to foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope so. You&#8217;ll not plead, eh, that you are pledged
to hunt six days a week, and cannot come? that you&#8217;ve a snug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
house and some thought of bringing a wife to it one day, and
cannot come? that you are training a dog to the gun, and
cannot come&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Nance who broke in now. She had forgotten Rupert,
standing hungry and forlorn up the high moor and looking
down on his inheritance of Windyhough. Her old liking for
Will Underwood&mdash;a liking that had come near, during these
last days, to love and hero-worship&mdash;bade her defend their
guest against a tongue that was sharper than her father
guessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>know</i> he will be true. Why should you doubt him,
father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there, child! Who said I doubted him? It&#8217;s the
whole younger race of men I distrust. Will here must be
scapegoat&mdash;and, by that token, your glass is empty, Will.&#8221;</p>

<p>With entire disregard of anything that had gone before,
Squire Demaine filled another measure for his guest, pointed
to the chair across the hearth, and was about to give the news
from Scotland, word by word, when he remembered Nance.
&#8220;It will be only recruiting-talk, Nance&mdash;men to be counted
on in one place, and men we doubt in t&#8217;other. It would only
weary you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance came and stood between them, slim and passionate.
&#8220;I choose to stay, father. Your talk of men, of arms hidden
in the hay-mows and the byres, of the marching-out&mdash;that is
your part of the battle. But what afterwards?&#8221;</p>

<p>They glanced at her in some perplexity. She was so resolute,
yet so remote, in her eager beauty, from the highways
that men tramp when civil war is going forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;What afterwards?&#8221; grumbled Squire Roger. &#8220;Well, the
right King on the throne again, we hope. What else, my
girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After you&#8217;ve gone, father, and left the house to its women?
I&#8217;m mistress here, since&mdash;since mother died.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roger Demaine got to his feet hurriedly and took a pinch
of snuff. &#8220;Oh, have a care, Nance!&#8221; he protested noisily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
&#8220;There&#8217;s no need to remind me that your mother died. I
should have taken a whole heart to the Rising, instead of
half o&#8217; one, if she&#8217;d been alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance touched his hair lightly, in quick repentance of the
hurt she had given him. But she would not yield her point.
&#8220;I shall be left mistress here&mdash;mistress of a house made up
of women and old men&mdash;and you? You will be out in the
open, giving blows instead of nursing patience by the hearth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps&mdash;Nance, perhaps the Rising will not need us,
after all,&#8221; said Will Underwood, with a lame attempt to shirk
the issue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust that it will need you, sir&mdash;will need us both,&#8221; she
said, flinging round on him with the speed of her father&#8217;s
temper. &#8220;You thought I complained of the loneliness that is
coming? No&mdash;but, if I&#8217;m to take part in your war, I&#8217;ll know
what news you have.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roger Demaine patted her gently on the shoulder, and smiled
as if he watched a kitten playing antics with a serious face.
&#8220;The child is right, Will,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will be long and
lonely for her, come to think of it, and there&#8217;s no harm in
telling her the news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was the messenger, father?&#8221; she asked, leaning
against the mantel and looking down into the blazing log-fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Oliphant of Muirhouse, from the Annan country.
The best horseman north of the Solway, they say. He was
only here for as long as his message lasted, and off again for
Sir Jasper&#8217;s at Windyhough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And his news?&#8221; asked Will Underwood, watching the
fire-glow play about Nance&#8217;s clear-cut face and maidish figure.</p>

<p>The Squire drew them close to him, and glanced about him
again and, for all his would-be secrecy, his voice rang like a
trumpet-call before he had half told them of the doings up in
Scotland. For his loyalty was sane and vastly simple.</p>

<p>They were silent for a while, until Nance turned slowly and
stood looking at the two men. &#8220;It is all like a dream come
true. The hunger and the ache, father&mdash;the King in name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
reigning it here, and that other overseas&mdash;and grooms riding
while their masters walk&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon be up in saddle again,&#8221; broke in old Roger
brusquely. &#8220;Oliphant of Muirhouse brings us news that will
end all that. The country disaffected, the old loyalty waiting
for a breeze to stir it&mdash;how can we fail? I tell you there&#8217;s
to be another Restoration, and all the church bells ringing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He halted, glancing at Will Underwood, who was pacing up
and down the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve the look of a trapped wild-cat, Will,&#8221; he said
irascibly. &#8220;I fancied my news would please you&mdash;but, dear
God, you younger men are cold! You can follow your fox
over hedge and dyke and take all risks. It&#8217;s only when the
big hunt is up that you begin to count the value of your necks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Underwood turned sharply. Some trouble of his own had
stood between him and the Rising news, but the Squire&#8217;s gibe
had touched him now. &#8220;The big hunt has been up many
times, sir,&#8221; he said impatiently. &#8220;We&#8217;ve heard the Stuart
shouting Tally-ho all down from Solway to the Thames&mdash;but
we&#8217;ve never seen the fox. Oliphant is too sanguine always.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Roger cut him short. &#8220;Oliphant, by grace o&#8217; God, is
like a bit of Ferrara&#8217;s steel. I wish we had more like him.
In my young days we did not talk, and talk&mdash;we got to saddle
when such as Oliphant of Muirhouse came to rouse us.
You&#8217;re cold, I tell you, Will. Your voice rings sleety.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will Underwood glanced slowly from his host to Nance.
He saw that she was watching him, and caught fire from her
silent, half-disdainful question. Hot words&mdash;of loyalty and
daring&mdash;ran out unbidden. And Nance, in turn, warmed to
his mood; for it was so she had watched him take his fences
on hunting-days, so that he had half persuaded her to love him
outright and have done with it.</p>

<p>But old Roger was still unconvinced. &#8220;We may be called
out within the month. Have you set your house in order,
Will?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the younger man seemed to be looking backward to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
some trouble that had dwarfed his impulse. &#8220;Why, no, sir,&#8221;
he answered lamely. &#8220;Surely I have had no time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; put in the other dryly. &#8220;At my time of life,
Will, men learn to set things in order before the call comes.
Best have all in readiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>A troubled silence followed. They stood in the thick of
peril soon to come, and Squire Roger, haphazard and unthinking
at usual times, had struck a note of faith that was deep,
far sounding, not to be denied. As if ashamed of his feeling,
openly expressed, the Squire laughed clumsily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was boasting, Nance,&#8221; he said, putting a rough hand on
her shoulder, &#8220;and that&#8217;s more dangerous than hunting foxes&mdash;bagged
foxes brought overseas from Hanover. Bless me!
you were talking of staying here as mistress, and I&#8217;ll not
allow it. I&#8217;ve had a plan in my head since Oliphant first
brought the news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father, I must stay here. Where else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Windyhough. No, girl, I&#8217;ll have no arguments about
it. You&#8217;ll be protected there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will Underwood laughed, and somehow Nance liked him
none the better for it. &#8220;Sir Jasper will go with us, and
Maurice, and every able-bodied man about the place&mdash;who
will be left to play guardian to Nance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rupert, unless I&#8217;ve misjudged the lad,&#8221; snapped the Squire.</p>

<p>&#8220;He cannot protect himself, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. May be not&mdash;just yet. But I&#8217;ve faith in that lad,
somehow. He&#8217;ll look after other folk&#8217;s cattle better than his
own. Some few are made in that mould, Will. It&#8217;s a good
mould, and rare.&#8221;</p>

<p>His secret trouble, and his jealousy of any man who threatened
to come close to Nance, swept Will Underwood&#8217;s prudence
clean away. He should have known by now this bluff,
uncompromising tone of the Squire&#8217;s. &#8220;She&#8217;s safer here, sir,&#8221;
he blundered on. &#8220;We all know Rupert for a scholar&mdash;I&#8217;d
rather trust Nance to her own women-servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I would not,&#8221; put in old Roger dryly, &#8220;and I happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to have a say in the matter. If Rupert&#8217;s a fool&mdash;well, he
shall have his chance of proving it. Nance, you go to Windyhough.
That&#8217;s understood? The house down yonder can
stand a siege, and this cannot. My fool of a grandfather&mdash;God
rest him, all the same!&mdash;dismantled the house here. He
thought there&#8217;d never again be civil war in Lancashire&mdash;but
down at Windyhough they lived in hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance laughed&mdash;the brave laugh of a woman cradled in a
house of gallant faith, of loyalty to old tradition. She understood
her father&#8217;s breezy, offhand talk of civil war, as if
it were a pleasant matter. He would have chosen other means,
she knew, if peace had shown the road; but better war, of
friend against friend, than this corroding apathy that had
fallen on men&#8217;s ideals since the King-in-name ruled England
by the help of foreign mercenaries.</p>

<p>Will Underwood caught infection from these two. The one
was hale, bluff and hard-riding, a man proven; the other was
a slip of a lassie, slender as a reed and fanciful; yet each
had the same eager outlook on this matter of the Rising&mdash;an
outlook that admitted no compromise, no asking whether the
time were ripe for sacrifice and peril. The moment was instinct
with drama to Underwood, and he was ready always to
step into the forefront of a scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;When are we needed, sir?&#8221; he asked, with a grave simplicity
that was equal to their own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Within the month, if all goes well with the march.
There&#8217;s little time, Will, and much to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, there&#8217;s much to do&mdash;but we shall light a fire for every
loyalist to warm his hands at. May the Prince come soon,
say I.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Squire glanced sharply at him. Will&#8217;s tone, his easy,
gallant bearing, removed some doubts he had had of late touching
the younger man&#8217;s fidelity; and when, a little later, Nance
said that she would leave them to their wine, he permitted
Will to open the door for her, to follow her for a moment into
the draughty hall. He noticed, with an old man&#8217;s dry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
charitable humour, that Nance dropped her kerchief as she
went out, and that Will picked it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hunt is up,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;The finest hunt is up
that England ever saw&mdash;and these two are playing a child&#8217;s
game of drop-kerchief. There&#8217;ll be time to make love by and
by, surely, when peace comes in again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Squire was restless. To his view of the Prince&#8217;s
march from Scotland, there was England&#8217;s happiness at stake.
He would have to wait three weeks or so, drilling his men,
rousing his neighbours to the rally, doing fifty things a day to
keep his patience decently in bounds. He needed the gallop
south, and the quick dangers of the road; and here, instead,
were two youngsters who fancied love was all.</p>

<p>Outside in the hall Nance and Will Underwood were facing
each other with a certain grave disquiet. The wind was rising
fast; its song overhead among the chimney-stacks was
wild and comfortless; the draught of it crept down
the stairs, and under the main door, and through ill-fitting
casements, blowing the candle-flames aslant and shaping
the droppings into what the country-folk called &#8220;candle-corpsies.&#8221;
Somewhere from the kitchen a maidservant was
singing a doleful ballad, dear to rustic Lancashire, of one Sir
Harry of Devilsbridge, who rode out to his wedding one day
and never was seen again save as a ghost that haunted Lang
Rigg Moss.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lively tune for Rising men to march to,&#8221; said
Underwood, ill at ease somehow, yet forcing a gay laugh.
&#8220;If I were superstitious&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are all superstitious,&#8221; broke in the other, restless as
her father. &#8220;Since babyhood we&#8217;ve listened to that note
i&#8217; the wind. Oh, it sobs, and will not any way be still! It
comes homeless from the moors, and cries to us to let it
in. Martha is right to be singing yonder of souls crying
over the Moss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Will Underwood yielded to place and circumstance.
He had watched Nance grow up from lanky girlhood into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
womanhood that, if it had no extravagance of beauty, arrested
every man&#8217;s attention and made him better for the pause.
He had hunted with her, in fair weather and in foul, had sat
at meat with her in this house that kept open, hospitable doors.
Yet, until to-night, he had not seen her as she was, a child
of the moors, passionate, wayward, strong for the realities of
human pity, human need for faith and constancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have your kerchief, Nance,&#8221; he said. The gravity, the
quietness of his tone surprised her. &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep it, by your
leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced at him, and there was trouble in her eyes.
This news of the Rising had stirred every half-forgotten
longing, inbred in her, that a Stuart might reign again, gallant
and debonair and kingly, over this big-little land of England.
She wished the old days back, with desperate eagerness&mdash;the
days when men were not blameless, as in a fairy-tale, but when,
at any rate, they served their King for loyalty instead of prudence.
Yet, now, with Will Underwood here, her hopes of the
Rising grew shadowy and far-away. She was not thinking of
England or the Stuart; she was asking herself, with piteous
appeal for help, whether her own little life was to be marred or
made by this big, loose-built man whom all women were supposed
to love at sight. She drew her skirts away from such intemperate,
unstable love; but she had known Will Underwood
long, had dreamed of him o&#8217; nights, had shaped him to some
decent likeness of a hero.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;ll not keep it. You will give it back to me.
Oh, I insist!&#8221; she broke off, again with her father&#8217;s quick,
heedless need to be obeyed.</p>

<p>He put the kerchief into her hand. &#8220;So you&#8217;re sending me
a beggar to the wars,&#8221; he said sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you go to the wars&#8221;&mdash;she was looking wistfully at
him, as if asking for some better answer to her need of
faith&mdash;&#8220;you shall take it with you, Mr. Underwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You doubt me, Nance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubt? I doubt everything these days: you, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Prince&#8217;s march from Scotland, and all&mdash;why, all I&#8217;m too
tired to hope for. You do not guess how tired I am. To-morrow,
may be, the wind will be quieter&mdash;and Martha will
not be singing from the kitchens how Sir Harry rode over
Devilsbridge and came back, without his body, to haunt the
moors. Good-night, Mr. Underwood. Go talk with father of
the Rising.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet still they lingered for a moment. Through all her
weariness&mdash;through the vague distrust that was chilling her&mdash;she
remembered the day-time intimacy, the nights of long,
girlish dreams, that had gone to the making of her regard
for Will. It was untrue&mdash;it must be untrue&mdash;that he was half-hearted
in this enterprise that was to set England free of the
intolerable yoke. If Will&#8217;s honour went by the board, she
would begin to doubt her own good faith.</p>

<p>What was passing in Will Underwood&#8217;s mind he himself
scarcely knew, perhaps. He was full of trouble, indecision;
but he glanced at Nance, saw the frank question and appeal
in her face, and his doubts slipped by him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall claim that kerchief, Nance,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;before the
month is out, if Oliphant brought a true message south.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance glanced at him. &#8220;Mr. Oliphant never lies. His
enemies admit as much. So come for what I&#8217;ll give&mdash;if you
come before the month is out.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was gone before he could insist on one last word, and
Will Underwood turned impatiently to seek his host. A
half-hour later, after she had heard him get to saddle and
ride away, Nance came downstairs, and found her father
pacing up and down the dining-chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, you?&#8221; growled old Roger. &#8220;I thought you were
in bed by this time, child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot sleep.&#8221; She came to his side, and put a friendly
arm through his. &#8220;Father, am I right? It seems there are
so many&mdash;so many of our men who are cold&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, damme, that&#8217;s just what I was thinking,&#8221; roared
the Squire, his good-humour returning when another shared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
his loneliness. &#8220;It&#8217;s the older men who are warm&mdash;the older
men who are going to carry this business through. It was
not so in my young days. Our fathers licked us into better
shape, and we&#8217;d fewer luxuries, may be. Why, child, we
dared not play fast and loose with loyalty, as some of these
young blades are doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They ask for reasons, father. Young Hunter of Hunterscliff
rode up to me to-day, as we were waiting for hounds
to strike the scent. And I spoke of the Rising, because I can
think of little else these days; and he yawned, in the lackadaisical
way he brought from London a year ago, and said
the Prince was following a wild-goose chase. And he, too,
asked for reasons&mdash;asked why he should give up a hunting
life for the pleasure of putting his neck into a halter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roger Demaine stood, square and big, with his back to the
fire. His fine apparel, the ordered comfort of the room,
could not disguise his ruggedness. He was an out-of-doors
man, simple, passionate, clean as the winds and an open life
could make him. &#8220;Hunter of Hunterscliff will put his neck
into a worse halter if he airs such shallow stuff. I&#8217;d have had
him ducked in the nearest horse-pond if he&#8217;d said that to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two looked quietly at each other, father and daughter,
each knowing that there was need of some deeper confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dropped your kerchief just now, Nance,&#8221; said Roger
dryly, &#8220;and Will Underwood picked it up. Did he keep
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was full of trouble. Her father&#8217;s happiness, the
welfare of the English land which she loved almost to idolatry,
her trust in Underwood&#8217;s honour, were all at stake. But she
stood proud and self-reliant. &#8220;Did you train me to drop my
kerchief for any man to keep? I tell you, sir&mdash;as I told Mr.
Underwood just now&mdash;that he may claim it when&mdash;when he
has proved himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Squire was in complete good-humour now. This girl
of his was as a woman should be, suave and bendable as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
hazel-twig, yet strong, not to be broken by any onset of the
wind. He could afford to tease her, now that his mind was
easy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, surely Will has proved himself,&#8221; he said, smiling
down at her from his big height. &#8220;He can take his fences with
any man. He can take his liquor, too, when need asks, and
watch weaker men slide gently under-table. He can hit four
birds out of five, Nance, and is a proper lady&#8217;s man as well.
Dear heart! what more does the child ask from a lover?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask so little of him&mdash;just to ride out, and ride in again
after the bells are ringing a Stuart home. To risk a little
hardship. To come out of his hunting and his pretty parlour
ways, and face the open. What else does any woman claim
from any man, when&mdash;oh, when the need is urgent? Father,
it was you who taught me what this Rising means&mdash;it is
Faith, and decency, and happiness for England, fighting
against a rabble brought overseas from Germany, because
they cannot trust the English army. It is&mdash;the breath of our
English gardens that&#8217;s at stake, and yet such as this Hunterscliff
lad can yawn about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will Underwood yawns, you mean,&#8221; snapped the Squire.
&#8220;It was Underwood you were thinking of. I share your
doubts, Nance. He is this and that, and a few men speaking
well of him&mdash;but there&#8217;s a flaw in him somewhere. I
never could set a finger on it, but the flaw is there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned on him, with hot inconsequence. &#8220;He is not
proved as yet. I said no more than that. You never liked
him, father. You&mdash;you are unjust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no; I never liked him. But I&#8217;m content to wait.
If I&#8217;ve misjudged him, I&#8217;ll admit it frankly. Does it go
so very deep, child, this liking for Wild Will?&#8221; he broke off,
with rough, anxious tenderness. &#8220;I&#8217;m clumsy with women&mdash;I
always was&mdash;and you&#8217;ve no mother to go to in search of
a good, healthy cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should it go deep?&#8221; she asked, with a pride that
would not yield as yet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve watched you both. The ways of a man and a
maid&mdash;bless me, they are old as the hills. Of course, he&#8217;s
good to look at, and there&#8217;s naught against him, so far as I
know; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will let him prove himself. His chance will not be
long in coming, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bade him good-night gravely, yet with a shy, impulsive
tenderness, and went up to her own room. The moon was
staring in through the low, broad window-space. A keen
frost was setting fingers on the glass already; she brushed
away the delicate tracery and stood watching the silent, empty
lands without. No sleet was falling now. She could see
each line of wall that climbed, dead-black by contrast, up the
white slope of the pastures. Beyond and high above, a steel-blue
sky marked, ridge by ridge, the rough, uncompromising
outline of the moor.</p>

<p>It was a scene desolate beyond belief, and would have chilled
one foreign to the country; but Nance looked up the wintry
slopes as if she found a haven there. There was no illusion
attaching to this riding-out of the war-men from Lancashire.
She was not swayed by any casual glamour of the pipes, any
kilted pageantry of warfare. Her father had taught her, patiently
enough, that the Stuarts, though they chanced to capture
the liking of most decent women, were intent on graver business.
Not once, in the years that had gone before this call to arms,
had he trained her to an ideal lower than his own. The Stuart,
to his belief, stood for charity, for sacrifice, for unbending
loyalty to the Faith once delivered. And such outlook,
as he had told her plainly, made neither for pageantry nor
sloth.</p>

<p>Nance, watching the sleety wilderness outside, hearing the
yelp of the wind as it sprang from the bitter, eastern bank
of cloud, recalled her father&#8217;s teaching with a new, sudden
understanding. This sleety land, with its black field-walls
climbing to the windy moor above, was eloquent in its appeal
to her. There was storm and disaster now&mdash;but there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
heather-time to come, and bees among the ling, and the clear,
high sunshine over all. Old Squire Demaine, with all his
rough-and-ready faults, had taught her faith.</p>

<p>She forgot her trouble touching Will Underwood. The
rough, moonlit moor reminded her, in some odd way, of Rupert&mdash;of
the scholar who a little while ago, up yonder, had
taken some fancied quarrel of her own upon his slim shoulders.
Somewhere, hidden by the easy pity of the years, was
a faith in this scholar who caused misgiving to his friends.
She remembered that her father&mdash;the last man in Lancashire
to be tolerant of a fool&mdash;would listen to no gibes at Rupert&#8217;s
expense, that he had bidden her, soon as the hunt was up in
earnest, seek refuge at Windyhough.</p>

<p>These white, rough uplands did not bring Will Underwood
back to mind at all. They brought only the picture of a lean,
wind-driven dreamer, who had tramped the moors all day for
the pleasure of sharing his own thoughts with the wilderness.
She recalled the look in his face when she had surprised
him&mdash;the tired question in it, as if he were asking why
circumstances had piled up so many odds against him; then the
welcome, idolatrous almost in its completeness, that his eyes
had given her when he realised that she was near, and after
that the curt request that Will Underwood should ride with
her, while he settled some difference with his brother.</p>

<p>A woman likes to be worshipped, likes a man to show fight
on her behalf; and Nance, watching the stark, moonlit fields,
for the first time felt a touch of something more than pity for
the heir of Windyhough.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE NIGHT-RIDER</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Down</span> at Windyhough, where the old house thrust its gables
up into the shelter of its firs and leafless sycamores, Sir Jasper
Royd sat listening to the messenger who had ridden from
Squire Roger&#8217;s. Lady Royd, who kept her beauty still at five-and-forty,
and with it some air of girlish petulance and wilfulness,
sat on the other side of the hearth. Oliphant of Muirhouse
stood between them, after supping hastily, with the air
of a man who cannot sit unless the saddle carries him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We owe you a great debt for bringing in the news,&#8221; Sir
Jasper was saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so sure of that, sir,&#8221; put in Lady Royd, with
sharpness and a hint of coquetry. &#8220;You are robbing me of a
husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, surely,&#8221; said Oliphant, with a touch of his quick humour.
&#8220;The Prince will restore him to you by and by.
We&#8217;re all for Restoration these days, Lady Royd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know! And you&#8217;ve passed your wine over the
water before you set lips to it. I know your jargon, Mr. Oliphant&mdash;but
it is lives of men you are playing with.&#8221; A
stronger note sounded in her spoiled, lazy voice; she glanced
at her husband, asking him to understand her passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not playing with,&#8221; said the messenger, breaking an uneasy
pause. &#8220;Lives of men were given them to use.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, by gad!&#8221; broke in Sir Jasper unexpectedly. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sixty, Mr. Oliphant, and the Prince needs me, and I feel a
lad again. I&#8217;ve been fox-hunting here, and shooting, and
what not, just to keep the rust out of my old bones in case
I was needed by and by&mdash;but I was spoiling all the while
for this news you bring.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>&#8220;What are the chances, Mr. Oliphant?&#8221; asked Lady Royd,
with odd, impulsive eagerness. &#8220;For my part, I see a county
of easy-going gentlemen and bacon-eating clowns, who
wouldn&#8217;t miss one dinner for the Cause. The Cause? A few
lean Highlanders; a lad who happens to carry the name of
Stuart; the bagpipes waking our hills in protest with their
screeching&mdash;righteous protest, surely&mdash;I see no hope in this
affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant was striding up and down the room. He halted,
faced this petted woman of the world; and she wondered how
it came that a man so muddied and so lined with weariness
could smile as if he came down to breakfast after a night of
pleasant sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chances? All in our favour, Lady Royd. We&#8217;re
few, and hold the Faith. We never count the chances; we
just march on from day to day.&#8221; His smile grew broader.
&#8220;And, by your leave, you&#8217;ll not speak ill of the pipes. They&#8217;re
food and drink to us, when other rations fall a little short.
The pipes? You&#8217;ve never heard them, surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, to my cost,&#8221; put in the other shrewishly. &#8220;They&#8217;re
like&mdash;like an east wind singing out of tune, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then Oliphant grew hot on the sudden, as Highlanders
will when they defend a thing that is marrow of their bones.
&#8220;The pipes? You&#8217;ll hear them rightly, I hope, before you
die. The soft, clear tongue of them! They&#8217;ll drone to ye,
soft as summer, Lady Royd, and bring the slopes o&#8217; Lomond
to your sight&mdash;and you&#8217;ll hear the bees all busy in the thyme;
and then they&#8217;ll snarl at you, and stretch your body tight as
whipcord&mdash;and then you taste the fight that&#8217;s brewing up&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Lady Royd; &#8220;but you ask me for my husband,
and I&#8217;m loth to part with him. Not all the pipes in Scotland
may comfort me after&mdash;after this fight that you say is brewing
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper glanced at her. He had followed her whimsies
with great chivalry and patience for six-and-twenty years,
because it happened that he loved her, once for all; but he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
not heard, till now, this answering care for his safety, this
foolish and tempestuous wish to keep him by her side.</p>

<p>Oliphant of Muirhouse understood their mood. He had
ridden through the lonely places, counting life cheap; and
such men grow quick of intuition. &#8220;Your husband?&#8221; he
echoed. &#8220;I only claim his promises. He&#8217;ll return to you,
after paying pleasant debts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! but will he return?&#8221;</p>

<p>The messenger was surprised again into open confession of
his faith. &#8220;One way or another you will meet&mdash;yes. The
good God sees to that,&#8221; he answered gravely. &#8220;And now,
Sir Jasper, we&#8217;ve talked enough, and my bed lies ten miles
farther on. Your roads are quagmires&mdash;the only bad things
I&#8217;ve found yet in Lancashire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Oliphant, you&#8217;ll stay the night here? I&#8217;ll call you at
daybreak if needs must.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sleep&mdash;a little later, friend&mdash;and at your house another
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>His smile was easy as he bade farewell to Lady Royd and
gripped his host&#8217;s hand for a moment; but Sir Jasper saw
him stumble a little as he made towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far have you ridden to-day?&#8221; he asked sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, fifty miles, no more&mdash;with a change of horses. Why
d&#8217;ye ask?&#8221; said Oliphant, turning in some surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you look underfed and over-ridden, man. Stay
here the night, I say. The Prince himself would not ask
more of you if he could see you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince least of all, perhaps. It is his way to shift
burdens on to his own shoulders&mdash;if we would let him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd found a moment&#8217;s respite from her spoiled and
stunted outlook, from the sense of foreboding and of coming
loss&mdash;loss of the husband whom, in some queer way, she
loved. She looked at Oliphant of Muirhouse, standing in the
doorway and looking backward at them; and she wondered
by what gift he could be sleepless and saddle-sore, serene
and temperately gay, all at the one time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8220;Mr. Oliphant,&#8221; she said, &#8220;this lad with the Stuart name
gets more than his deserts. He has few men like yourself
among his following, surely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has many better men.&#8221; Oliphant, weary of everything
except the need to get his ten-mile errand done and
snatch the sleep he needed, bowed prettily enough to his
hostess. &#8220;The Prince, God bless him, sets the keynote for
us all. He makes weaklings into&mdash;something better, Lady
Royd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Royd&#8217;s wife, she knew not why, thought suddenly of Rupert,
her elder-born, and she yielded to the temper that had
not been curbed throughout her married life. &#8220;Then would
God my son could come under the Prince&#8217;s discipline! He&#8217;s
the heir to Windyhough&mdash;laugh with me, Mr. Oliphant, while
I tell you what a weakling he is. He can ride, after a fashion&mdash;but
not to hounds; he can only read old books in the library,
or take his gun up to these evil moors my husband loves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper&#8217;s temper was slow to catch fire, but it was burning
now with a fierce, dismaying heat. He would have spoken&mdash;words
that would never be forgotten afterwards between
his wife and him&mdash;if Oliphant had not surprised them both by
the quietness of his interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has had no chance to prove himself, I take it?&#8221; he
broke in, with a certain tender gravity. &#8220;I was in that plight
once&mdash;and the chance came&mdash;and it seemed easy to accept it.
Good-night to you, Lady Royd, and trust your son a little
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper was glad to follow his guest out of doors into
the courtyard, where a grey-blue moon was looking down on
the late-fallen sleet. Oliphant&#8217;s horse, tied to the bridle-ring
at the door, was shivering in the wind, and his master patted
him with the instinctive, friendly comradeship he had for all
dumb things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only ten more miles, old lad,&#8221; he muttered, hunting for
sugar in the pockets of his riding-coat, and finding two small
pieces.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>As he was untying the bridle a sound of feet came up the
roadway. The courtyard gate was opened, and three figures,
unheroic all of them, came trudging in. They crossed the
yard slowly, and they were strangely silent.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper and his guest stared at the three in blank surprise
as they drew near. The moonlight showed them Maurice,
carrying a black eye and a battered face with the jauntiness
inborn in him, and Rupert, bending a little under the
bruises that were patent enough, and a horse that moved dejectedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been hunting with a vengeance, boys,&#8221; said Sir
Jasper, after long scrutiny of the sons who stood shamefacedly
at attention. &#8220;Who was it marked your face so prettily,
Maurice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Rupert, sir. We had a quarrel&mdash;and he half-killed
me&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t make him yield.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper was aware of an unreasoning happiness, a sense
that, in the thick of coming dangers, he had found something
for which he had been searching many years. If he had been
Squire Demaine, his intimate friend and neighbour, he would
have clapped Rupert on the back, would have bidden his sons
drown their quarrel in a bumper. But he was more scholarly,
less hale of body than Roger Demaine, and he tasted this new
joy as if he feared to lose its flavour. He had fought Rupert&#8217;s
cause so long, had defended him against the mother
who despised and flouted him. Under all disappointment had
been the abiding faith that his heir would one day prove himself.
And now&mdash;here was Rupert, bruised and abashed, and
Maurice, proud of this troublesome brother who had fought
and would not yield.</p>

<p>It was all so workaday, so slight a matter; but Sir Jasper
warmed to these two lads as if they had returned from capturing
a city for the rightful King. They were bone of his
bone, and they had fought together, and Rupert had forgotten
that he was born a weakling.</p>

<p>Oliphant of Muirhouse looked on. He remembered both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
lads well, for he had halted often at Windyhough during these
last troubled years, had seen the heir grow into reedy and neglected
manhood, the younger brother claiming notice and regard
from every one, by reason of his ready wit, his cheeriness,
his skill at sports of all kinds. From the first Oliphant&#8217;s
sympathy had been with the elder-born, with the scholar at
whom men laughed; for he could never quite forget his own
past days. He looked on to-night, glad of this touch of human
comedy that came to lighten his desolate rides between one post
of danger and the next.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, lads,&#8221; said Sir Jasper, with gruff kindliness, &#8220;you
were fools to seek a quarrel. Brother should love brother&#8221;&mdash;he
laughed suddenly, a boy&#8217;s laugh that disdains maxims&mdash;&#8220;but
there&#8217;s no harm in a fight, just now and then. What was your
quarrel, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>They glanced at each other; but it was Rupert who first broke
the silence, not Maurice as in bygone days. &#8220;We cannot tell
you, sir,&#8221; he said, with a dignity in odd contrast with his
swollen, red-raw face. &#8220;Indeed, we cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, out here in the sleety wind, was not aware of cold
or the coming hardships. His heir was showing firmness, and
he tempted him into some further show of courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, boy! You tell me all your secrets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert lifted his battered face. &#8220;Not this one, sir&mdash;and if
Maurice tells it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there! Get indoors, lads, and ask the housekeeper
for a raw beefsteak.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice went obediently enough, knowing this tone of his
father&#8217;s. But Rupert halted on the moonlit threshold, turned
in his odd, determined way, and came to Oliphant&#8217;s side. The
messenger, standing with an arm through the bridle of his
restive horse, was embarrassed by the look in the boy&#8217;s
eyes&mdash;the eager glance of youth when it meets its hero face
to face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is your guest, father?&#8221; asked Rupert, as a child asks
a question, needing to be answered quickly. &#8220;He has often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
come to Windyhough, but always in haste. You would never
tell me what his name was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Oliphant of Muirhouse. Who else?&#8221; Sir Jasper answered,
surprised by this sudden question. And then he
glanced at Oliphant, ashamed of his indiscretion. &#8220;The boy
will keep your secret,&#8221; he added hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt at all of that, sir,&#8221; said the messenger.</p>

<p>So then Rupert said little, because it seemed this meeting
was too good to hope for in a world that had not used him very
well. He had heard talk of Oliphant, while his father sat beside
the hearth o&#8217; nights and praised his loyalty. From the
grooms, too, he had heard praise of the horsemanship of this
night-rider, who was here to-day and gone to-morrow, following
the Stuart&#8217;s business. And, because he had leisure for
many dreams, he had made of Oliphant a hero of more immaculate
fibre than is possible in a world of give-and-take.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is father jesting?&#8221; asked the boy. &#8220;You are&#8221;&mdash;the catch
in his voice, the battered face he lifted to the moonlight, were
instinct with that comedy which lies very close to tears&mdash;&#8220;you
are Oliphant of Muirhouse? Why, sir, I think the Prince himself
could&mdash;could ask no more from me&mdash;if only I were able.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice broke outright. And the two elders, somewhere
from the haunted lands of their own boyhood, heard the clear
music that had been jarred, these many years, by din of the
world&#8217;s making.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Oliphant of Muirhouse,&#8221; said the messenger gruffly,
&#8220;and that&#8217;s not much to boast of. Is there any service I can
render you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert, astonished that this man should be so simple and
accessible, blurted out the one consuming desire he had in life.
&#8220;I ride so clumsily: teach me to sit a horse, sir, and gallop on
the Prince&#8217;s business&mdash;to be like other men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant reached out and grasped his hand. &#8220;That will be
simple enough one day,&#8221; he said cheerily. &#8220;Sir Jasper, your
son is staunch. We&#8217;ll need him by and by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet Oliphant, after he had said good-bye and ridden out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the white and naked country, was feeling as tired and unheroic
as any man in Lancashire. The wind was pitiless, the roads
evil, half between thaw and a gaining frost. Sleep was a
constant menace to him, for he had had little during the past
week. He was saddle-sore, and every bone of a body not too
robust at best seemed aching with desire for rest. Moreover,
this land of hills, and hills beyond, riding desolate to the grey
sky and the shrouded moon, was comfortless as any step-mother.
He knew that his faith, his loyalty, were sound; but
no inspiration reached him from these tired and stubborn
friends; he was in that mood&mdash;it comes equally to those who
have done too ill or too well in life&mdash;when he was ready to exchange
all chances of the future for an hour of rest. He knew
that a good horse was under him, that his hands were sure on
the reins whenever a sudden hill or a slippery turning met him
by the way; for the rest, he was chilled and lifeless.</p>

<p>The last two miles of his journey asked too much of his
strength. He swayed in the saddle, and thought that he must
yield to this sickness that was creeping over him. Then quietly
from the gaunt and sleety hills, Rupert&#8217;s voice came whispering
at his ear. He recalled the lad&#8217;s bruised face, the passionate
idolatry he had shown when he knew that Oliphant of
Muirhouse was the guest at Windyhough.</p>

<p>&#8220;By gad! the boy would think me a fool if I gave in now,&#8221;
he muttered. &#8220;And the message&mdash;it <i>must</i> go forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rode with new heart for the house where his errand lay.
He got indoors, and gave his message. Then he looked round,
and saw a couch that was drawn up near the hearth, and for
four-and-twenty hours they could not rouse him from the
sleep that had carried him back to Rupert&#8217;s land o&#8217; dreams.</p>

<p>Rupert himself, meanwhile, had stood for a while with his
father in the courtyard. The sleet and the east wind could not
interrupt the warm friendship that held between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the news, father?&#8221; he asked, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good news enough, lad. The Prince has left Edinburgh
on his march south&mdash;there has been a ball at Holyrood, all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the old way, and they say that only churls were absent. His
route lies through Lancashire. At long last, Rupert, we&#8217;re
needed, we men of Lancashire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not fail,&#8221; said Rupert buoyantly. &#8220;How could
we, sir? The preparation&mdash;the loyalty waiting only for its
chance&mdash;I forgot, sir,&#8221; he finished, with sudden, weary impotence.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not one of you. I got all this from books,
as mother said to me last night. She was wrong, for all that&mdash;I
learned it at your knee.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood looking at each other, father and son, seeking
help in this bleak wilderness of sleet. They were comrades;
yet now there seemed a deep gulf fixed between them, between
the strength and pity of the one, the weakness of the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I taught you no lies, at any rate,&#8221; said Sir Jasper gruffly.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go indoors and set your face to rights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father, I shall ride with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said the other, with brusque tenderness. &#8220;You
are not&mdash;not strong enough&mdash;you are untrained to stand the
hardships of a campaign.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert&#8217;s face grew white and set, as he understood the full
meaning of that word &#8220;untrained.&#8221; In the peaceful days it
had been well enough for him to stand apart, possessed by the
belief that he was weaker than his fellows; it was a matter of
his own suffering only; but now every loyal man in Lancashire
was needed by the Prince. His father&#8217;s hesitancy, the wish to
save him pain, were very clear to him. He had thought, in
some haphazard, dreamy way, that zeal and complete readiness
to die, if need be, for the Cause, were enough to make a
soldier of him. But now he realised that untrained men would
be a hindrance to the march, that he would be thwarting, not
aiding, the whole enterprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, you take it hardly, lad!&#8221; said Sir Jasper, ill at ease.
&#8220;Your place is here. You&#8217;ll be needed to guard Windyhough
and the women while we&#8217;re away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean it in kindness, sir, but&mdash;the fight will sweep
south, you tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>&#8220;It may sweep any way, once the country is astir. You may
find yourself fighting against long odds, Rupert, before you&#8217;ve
had time to miss us. Come, it is each to his own work these
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the hall, as they went in, Lady Royd was making much
of Maurice, obviously against his will. His hurts must be
seen to&mdash;how had he come by them?&mdash;he was looking grey
and ill&mdash;Maurice was ashamed of the twenty foolish questions
she put to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, I&#8217;m a grown man by now,&#8221; he was saying as
Sir Jasper entered. &#8220;The nursery days are over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; put in his elder brother, with a quick, heedless
laugh, &#8220;the nursery days are over, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to him, surprised by his tone and new air of
command. And on his face, too, she saw the marks of his
stubborn fight with Maurice; and something stirred in her&mdash;some
instinct foreign to her easy, pampered life&mdash;some touch
of pride that her elder-born could fight like other men.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it was you who fought with Maurice? Miracles do
not come singly, so they say.&#8221; From sheer habit she could not
keep back the gibe. &#8220;We shall have the skies raining heroes
soon if the heir of Windyhough&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet, wife!&#8221; broke in Sir Jasper hotly. &#8220;Your sons&mdash;God
help me that I have to say it!&mdash;your sons will be
ashamed of you in years to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper had been bitter once about his heir&#8217;s weakness.
He had met and conquered that trouble long ago, as straight-riding
men do, and had found a great love for Rupert,
a chivalrous and sheltering love that, by its very pity, broadened
the father&#8217;s outlook upon all men. Year by year, as he
saw that pride meant more than motherhood, the rift had
grown wider between husband and wife, though he had disguised
it from her; and this sudden, imperative fury of his
had been bred by many yesterdays.</p>

<p>Lady Royd stepped back, as if he had struck her, and a
strange quiet fell on all of them. The wind had shifted, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the twentieth time to-day, and was crying thinly round the
chimney-stacks. A grey, acrid smoke was trailing from the
hearth, and hail was beating at the windows. Somewhere,
from the stables at the rear, a farm dog was howling dismally.</p>

<p>Lady Royd shivered as she drew the lace more closely round
her neck. She was helpless against this storm that had gathered
out of doors and in. With an understanding too keen
for her liking, she realised what this Rising was doing to her
men-folk. The breath of it was abroad, stormy and swift.
It had made her husband restless, forgetful of the lover&#8217;s
homage that he had given until these last months; it had made
Rupert leave his books and dreams, from sheer desire of lustiness;
it had made Sir Jasper, here in the smoky hall, with the
thin wind blowing through it, say words of which already, if
his face were aught to go by, he repented.</p>

<p>It was Rupert that broke up a silence that dismayed more
practical folk. It had been his way to bear no malice; and
now, glancing at Lady Royd, he was aware that she needed
help. He came to her side&mdash;diffidently enough, as if he
feared repulse&mdash;and put a hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was right, sir,&#8221; he said, as if defending her against
his father. &#8220;I&#8217;d not had pluck to fight until to-day. I&mdash;I
was not what the heir should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper saw that tears were in his wife&#8217;s eyes, saw that
she was over-wrought and tired. &#8220;Get to bed, my lads,&#8221; he
said, with a friendly laugh&mdash;&#8220;and keep the peace, or I&#8217;ll lay
a heavy hand on the pair of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they were alone he turned to his wife. The wind&#8217;s
note was louder, the hail beat hard and quick about the windows,
the farm dog was howling ceaselessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was harsh just now,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Her face was older, yet more comely. &#8220;It was I
who was harsh. Rupert needed me all these years, and I
would not heed&mdash;and he was generous just now&mdash;and I&#8217;m
thinking of the years I&#8217;ve wasted.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Her repentance&mdash;yet awhile, at any rate&mdash;would be short-lived;
for winter is never a sudden and lasting convert to the
warmth of spring. Yet her grief was so patent, her voice so
broken and so tender, that Sir Jasper, in his simple way, was
thankful he was leaving Rupert, since leave him he must, to
better cheer than he had hoped for.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll find his way one day,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Be kind to him,
wife&mdash;it&#8217;s ill work for a man, I tell you, to be sitting at home
while other men are fighting. I&#8217;ll not answer for his temper.&#8221;
Then suddenly he smiled. &#8220;He&#8217;s a game pup, after all. To
see Maurice&#8217;s face when they came home together&mdash;and to
know that it was Rupert who had knocked it so pleasantly out
of shape&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there nothing pleases men but war?&#8221; the wife broke in
piteously. &#8220;Nothing but blows, and bruised faces&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing else in the world, dear heart&mdash;when war happens
to be the day&#8217;s business. Peace is well enough, after a man
has earned it honestly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd was tired, beaten about by this cold, northern
winter that had never tamed her love of ease. &#8220;Then women
have no place up here,&#8221; she said fretfully. &#8220;Bloodshed&mdash;how
we loathe it and all your needless quarrels! And all the while
we ask ourselves what does it matter which king is on the
throne, so long as our husbands are content to stay at home?
Women surely have no place up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, too, was tired in his own way. &#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ve a
place,&#8221; he answered sharply&mdash;&#8220;the place we fight to give you.
There&#8217;s only one King, wife&mdash;I&#8217;m pledged to his service, by
your leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; she said, with her pleasant drawl. &#8220;I know
that by heart. Faith, and the high adventure, and the King.
There&#8217;s only one matter you forget&mdash;the wife who sits at
home, and plies her needle, and fancies each stitch is a wound
her husband takes. You never saw that dark side of your
Rising?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wounds?&#8221; said the other gruffly. &#8220;We hide them, wife&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
is men&#8217;s business. The fruits of them we bring home&mdash;for
our wives to spend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;re bitter,&#8221; she pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not bitter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a man who knows his world&mdash;or
thinks he does. The men earn&mdash;and the women spend;
and you never guess how hard come by is that delicate gift,
honour, we bring you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honour?&#8221; She was peevish now. &#8220;I know that word,
too, by heart. It brings grief to women. It takes their men
afield when they have all they need at home. It brings swords
from the scabbard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It brings peace of soul, after the wounds are healed,&#8221; Sir
Jasper interrupted gravely.</p>

<p>Will Underwood about this time had reached his own house,
and had found his bailiff waiting for him. He had added
another wing to the house in the summer, and workmen had
been busy ever since in getting things to rights indoors in
readiness for the ball which Underwood had planned for
Christmas Eve&mdash;a ball that should outmatch in lavishness and
pomp all previous revels of the kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Eli?&#8221; growled the master, who was in no good
mood to-night. &#8220;Your face is sour enough. Have you
waited up to tell me that the men are discontented again with
their wages?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, with their King,&#8221; said the bailiff, blunt and dispassionate.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity, for we were getting gradely forrard with
the work&mdash;and you wanted all done by Kirstmas, so you said.
I&#8217;d not go up street myself to see any king that stepped.
Poorish folk and kings are much o&#8217; the same clay, I reckon.
Sexton at th&#8217; end of all just drops &#8217;em into six feet o&#8217; wintry
mould.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will Underwood&#8217;s father had held the like barren gospel,
expressed in terms more guarded. Perhaps some family instinct,
at variance with the coat he wore these days, had
prompted Will, at his father&#8217;s death, to keep as bailiff one of
the few &#8220;levellers&#8221; who were to be found in this loyal corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of the north. If so, he should have stood by his choice; but
instead he yielded to childish and unreasoning passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye think I&#8217;m missing my bed at this time o&#8217; night to hear
your ranting politics? It would be a poor king that couldn&#8217;t
prick your windbag for you, Eli. Stick to your ledgers and
the workmen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s them I&#8217;m trying to stick to,&#8221; broke in Eli, with that
impassive dead-weight of unbelief which is like a buckler to
some men. &#8220;The workmen are all gone daft about some
slip o&#8217; Belial they call Stuart Charlie. Squire Demaine has
been among and about them, talking of some moonshine about
a Rising; and Sir Jasper Royd has been among &#8217;em; and, what
with one and t&#8217; other, the men are gone daft, I tell you. They
talk in daylight o&#8217; what they dursen&#8217;t whisper to the dark a few
months since; they&#8217;re off to the wars, they reckon, and you
can whistle, maister, for your carpenters and painters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Underwood fidgeted up and down the room, and Eli
watched him furtively. The bailiff, apart from his negative
creed that every man was probably a little worse than his
neighbour, and princes blacker than the rest, was singularly
alive to his own interests. He had a comfortable billet here,
and was aware of many odd, unsuspected channels by which
he could squeeze money from the workmen busy with the new
wing of the house; it did not suit his interests that the master
should ride out to lose his head in company with Sir Jasper
and Squire Demaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stick to the chap that&#8217;s sitting on a throne, maister.
That&#8217;s my advice,&#8221; he said, gauging the other&#8217;s irresolution to
a nicety. &#8220;Weights are heavy to lift, especially when they&#8217;ve
been there for a long while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will Underwood found his better self for a moment. He
remembered the way of Sir Jasper, the look on Nance&#8217;s face
as she bade him ask for her kerchief when he was ready to go
out on a loyal errand. A distaste of Eli seized him; there
was no single line of the man&#8217;s squat body, no note of his
voice, that did not jar on him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>&#8220;Your tongue&#8217;s like a file, Eli,&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;You forget
that I&#8217;m a King&#8217;s man, too&mdash;a Stuart man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, not so much o&#8217; one,&#8221; broke in the other dryly, taking
full advantage of an old servant&#8217;s tyranny. &#8220;Your father
was weaned on thirst and brimstone, maister; and he was
reared, he was, on good, hot Gospeller&#8217;s stuff, such as they
used to preach at Rigstones Chapel; and he never lost the
habit when he gat up i&#8217; the world. Nay, there&#8217;s naught
Stuart about ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will Underwood, standing with a foot in either camp, was
accused not so much by Eli&#8217;s blunt, unlovely harshness as
by his own judgment of himself. He knew, now that he was
compelled to ask questions of himself, that all his instincts,
tap them deeply enough, were against monarchy of any sort&mdash;against
monarchy of soul over body, against the God these
Catholic gentry worshipped, against restraints of all kinds.
He saw Rigstones Chapel, standing harsh against the moor&mdash;the
home of a lonely, obscure sect unknown beyond its own
borders, a sect that had the east wind&#8217;s bitterness for creed,
but no remembrance of the summer&#8217;s charity. He remembered,
as a little chap, going to service at his father&#8217;s side, recalling
the thunder and denunciation from the pulpit, the
scared dreams that had shared his bed with him when afterwards
he went to sleep on Sabbath nights.</p>

<p>Underwood got himself in hand again. Those days were
far off, surely. Despite Eli&#8217;s unbelieving face, confronting
him, he was striving to forget that he had ever shared those
moorland walks to Rigstones Chapel. His father had learned
gradually that it was absurd to credit a score of people, assembled
in a wayside chapel, with the certainty that, out of the
world&#8217;s millions, they alone were saved; and afterwards
this same father had bought a fine house, because the
squire who owned it had gambled credit and all else away.
And the son had found a gift for riding horses, had learned
from women&#8217;s faces that they liked the look of him; and, from
small and crude beginnings, he had grown to be Wild Will, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
hunter who never shirked his fences, the gay lover who had
gathered about himself a certain fugitive romance that had
not been tested yet in full daylight.</p>

<p>Eli watched his master&#8217;s face. The hour was late. The
wind was shrill and busy here, as it was at Windyhough.
The world of the open moor, with its tempests and its downrightness,
intruded into this snug house of Underwood. Will
was shut off from his intimates, from the easy, heedless life,
that had grown to be second nature to him. He was aware of
a great loneliness, a solitude that his bailiff&#8217;s company seemed,
not to lessen, but to deepen. In some odd way he was standing
face to face with the realities of this Stuart love that had
been a pastime to him, a becoming coat to wear when he
dined or hunted with his friends. There was no pastime now
about the matter. He thought of Sir Jasper Royd, of Squire
Demaine, of others he could name who were ready to go out
into the wilderness because the time for words was over and
the time for deeds had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not just pleased, like, with all this moonshine about
the lad wi&#8217; yellow hair,&#8221; said Eli guardedly. &#8220;Now, there,
maister! I allus said ye had your grandfather&#8217;s stark common
sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will Underwood did not heed him. He began to pace up
and down the floor with the fury that Squire Demaine, not
long ago, had likened to that of a wild cat caught in a trap.
It was so plain to him, in this moment of enlightenment, how
great a price these friends of his were ready to pay without
murmur or question of reward. They had schooled themselves
to discipline; they were trained soldiers, in fact, ready
for blows or sacrifice, whichever chanced; their passing of the
loyal toast across the water had been a comely, vital ritual,
following each day&#8217;s simple prayer for restoration of the
Stuart Monarchy.</p>

<p>And he? Will listened to the gale that hammered at the
window, saw Eli&#8217;s inquisitive, hard face, fancied himself pacing
again the moorland road that led to Rigstones Chapel and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
gospel of negation. His frippery was stripped from him.
He felt himself a liar among honest men. He could find no
sneer to aim at the high, romantic daring of these folk who
were about to follow a Prince they had not seen; for he knew
that he was utterly untrained to such sacrifice as was asked
of him. To give up this house of his, the pleasant meetings
at the hunt or by the covert-side; to put his neck on the
block, most likely, for the sake of a most unbusiness-like transaction&mdash;it
was all so remote from the play-actor&#8217;s comedy
in which he had been a prime figure all these years. He had
not dreamed that Prince Charles Edward, in sober earnest,
would ever bring an army into pleasant England to disturb
its peace.</p>

<p>Eli watched the irresolution in his face. He, at least, was
business-like. He had none of the spirit that takes men out
on the forlorn hope, and he measured each moment of his life
as a chance for immediate and successful barter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maister,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;you&#8217;ve not heard, may
be, the rumour that&#8217;s going up and down the countryside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad news?&#8221; snapped Underwood. &#8220;You were always
ready to pass on that sort of rumour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <i>I</i> call it good news. They say Marshal Wade has
men enough under him to kill half Lancashire&mdash;and he&#8217;s marching
down this way from Newcastle to cut off these pesty
Scotchmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will Underwood turned sharply. &#8220;Is your news sure,
Eli?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure as judgment. I had it from one of Wade&#8217;s own
riders, who&#8217;s been busy hereabouts these last days, trying to
keep silly country-folk from leaving their homes for sake o&#8217;
moonshine. He laughed at this pretty-boy Prince, I tell ye,
saying he was no more than a lad who tries to rob an orchard
with the big farmer looking on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Underwood questioned him in detail about this messenger
of Marshal Wade&#8217;s, and from the bailiff&#8217;s answers, knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the man&#8217;s shrewdness, he grew sure that the odds were ludicrously
against the Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pledged to the Stuart Cause. You may go, Eli,&#8221; he
said, with the curtness he mistook for strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, you&#8217;re pledged, maister. But is it down in black and
white? As a plain man o&#8217; business, I tell ye no contract need
be kept unless it&#8217;s signed and sealed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And honour, you old fool?&#8221; snapped Underwood, afraid
of his own conscience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honour? That&#8217;s for gentry-folk to play with. You and
me, maister, were reared at Rigstones Chapel, where there was
no slippery talk o&#8217; that kind. It&#8217;s each for his own hand, to
rive his way through to the Mercy Throne. It&#8217;s a matter o&#8217;
business, surely&mdash;we just creep and clamber up, knowing
we&#8217;ve to die one day&mdash;and we&#8217;ve to keep sharp wits about us,
if we&#8217;re to best our neighbour at the job. It would be a poor
do, I reckon, if ye lost your chance by letting some other body
squeeze past ye, and get in just as th&#8217; Gates were shutting,
leaving ye behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole bleak past returned to Will Underwood. He
saw, as if it stood before him harsh against the rough hillocks
of the moor, the squat face of Rigstones Chapel. He heard
again the gospel of self-help, crude, arid, and unwashed, that
had thundered about his boyhood&#8217;s ears when his father took
him to the desolation that was known as Sabbath to the sect
that worshipped there. It had been all self-help there, in this
world&#8217;s business or the next&mdash;all a talk of gain and barter&mdash;and
never, by any chance, a hint of the over-glory that counts
sacrifice a pleasant matter, leading to the starry heights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eli, I washed my hands of all that years ago,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, and, later on try to wash &#8217;em of burning brimstone,
maister&mdash;it sticks, and it burns, does the hell-fire you used to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is something in a man deeper than his own schooling
of himself&mdash;a something stubborn, not to be denied, that
springs from the graves where his forefathers lie. To-night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
as he watched Eli&#8217;s grim mouth, the clean-shaven upper lip
standing out above his stubby beard, as he listened to his talk
of brimstone, he was no longer Underwood, debonair and glib
of tongue. He was among his own people again&mdash;so much
among them that he seemed now, not only to see Rigstones
Chapel, but to be living the old life once more, in the little
house, near the watermill that had earned the beginnings of
his grandfather&#8217;s riches. Thought by thought, impulse by
impulse, he was divided from these folk of later years&mdash;the
men and women who hunted, dined, and danced, with the
single purpose behind it all&mdash;the single hope that one day they
would be privileged to give up all, on the instant call, for
loyalty to the King who reigned in fact, if not in name. To-night,
with Eli&#8217;s ledger-like, hard face before him, Underwood
yielded to the narrower and more barren teaching that
had done duty for faith&#8217;s discipline at Rigstones Chapel. And
yet he would not admit as much.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a sly old sinner, Eli,&#8221; he said, with a make-believe
of the large, rollicking air which he affected.</p>

<p>The bailiff, glancing at his master&#8217;s face, knew that he had
prevailed. &#8220;Ay, just thereby,&#8221; he said, his face inscrutable
and hard. &#8220;But one way or another, I mean to keep free o&#8217;
brimstone i&#8217; the next world. It&#8217;s all a matter o&#8217; business, and
I tell ye so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Underwood went out into the frosty, moonlit night, and
paced up and down the house-front. His forebears had
given him one cleanly gift, at least&mdash;he needed always, when in
the thick of trouble, to get away from house-walls, out into
the open. The night was clear, between one storm and the
next, and the seven lamps of Charlie&#8217;s Wain swung high above
his head. He had to make his choice, once for all, and knew
it&mdash;the choice between the gospel of self-help and the wider
creed that sends men out to a simple, catholic sacrifice of
houseroom and good living.</p>

<p>He looked at the matter from every side, business-like as his
father before him. There were many pledges he had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that he would join his intimates when the summons came. If
they returned from setting a Stuart on the throne, the place
he had won among them would be valueless. But, on the
other hand, Eli&#8217;s news made it sure that they would not return,
that, if they kept whole skins at all, they would be driven into
exile overseas. He knew, too, that there were many lukewarm
men, prudent doubters, even among the gentry here whose
every instinct had been trained to the Stuart&#8217;s service. The
few hot-headed folk&mdash;the dreamers&mdash;were riding out to disaster
certain and foreknown&mdash;but there would be practical,
cool men enough left here in Lancashire to keep him company.</p>

<p>And there was Nance. He was on ground less sure now.
It lay deeper than he guessed, deeper than his love of hunting
and good-living, his passion for Nance Demaine. She was
at once his good and evil angel, and to-night he had to
choose his road. All that was best in his regard for her
pointed to the strict, narrow road of honour. And she had
promised him her kerchief when he returned from following
that road. And yet&mdash;to lose life and lands, may be&mdash;at best,
to be a fugitive in foreign countries&mdash;would that help him
nearer to the wooing? If he stayed here, she would be derelict
at Windyhough, would need his help. He could ride
down to the house each day, be at hand to tempt her with the
little flatteries that mean much when women are left in a
house empty of all men-folk. And, if danger came up the
moors after the Rising was crushed at birth by Marshal Wade,
he would be at hand to protect her.</p>

<p><i>To protect her.</i> He knew, down under all subterfuge, that
such as Nance find the surest protection when their men are
riding straight, and he was not riding straight to-night; and
finer impulses were stirring in him than he had felt through
five-and-thirty years of self-indulgence.</p>

<p>He glanced at the moors, saw again the squat, practical face
of Rigstones Chapel, heard Eli Fletcher&#8217;s east-wind, calculating
voice. He was true to his breed to-night, as he surrendered
to the bleak, unlovely past.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8220;Fools must gang their gait,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;but wise men
stay at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eli Fletcher was crossing the hall as he went in, and
glanced at the master&#8217;s face. &#8220;Shall we get forrard wi&#8217; the
building?&#8221; he asked, needing no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, Eli. And we&#8217;ll dance at Christmas, after this ill-guided
Rising is ended.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re your father over again,&#8221; said Eli, with grim approval.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE HURRIED DAYS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Uneasy</span> days had come to Lancashire. The men had grown
used to security, save for the risk of a broken neck on hunting-days,
their wives pampered and extravagant; for peace,
of the unhealthy sort, saps half their vigour from men and
women both. They had nothing to fear, it seemed. There
had been wars overseas, and others threatened; but their battles
had been fought for them by foreign mercenaries of King
George&#8217;s. For the rest, Lancashire hunted and dined and
diced, secure in the beauty of her women, the strength of her
men who rode to hounds and made love in the sleepy intervals.</p>

<p>And now the trumpet-call had sounded. None spoke abroad
of the news that Oliphant of Muirhouse and other messengers
were bringing constantly; but, when doors were closed, there
was eager talk of what was in the doing. And the elders of
the company were aware that, for every man who held loyalty
fast in his two hands, there were five at least who were
guarded in devotion, five who spoke with their lips, but whose
hearts were set on safety and the longing to enjoy more hunting
days.</p>

<p>It was this lukewarmness that harassed and exasperated
men like Sir Jasper and Squire Demaine. Better open enemies,
they felt&mdash;those who were frankly ranged against the
Old Faith, the Old Monarchy, the old traditions&mdash;than easy-going
friends who would talk but would not act. Here on
the windy heights of Lancashire they were learning already
what the stalwarts farther north were feeling&mdash;an intolerable
sickness, an impatience of those who wished for the return
of the old order, but had not faith enough to strike a blow for
it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Yet there were others; and day by day, as news of the
Prince&#8217;s march drifted down to Windyhough, Sir Jasper was
heartened to find that after all, he would bring a decent company
to join the Rising. Meanwhile, the lives they were living
day by day seemed odd to thinking men who, like Sir
Jasper, understood how imminent was civil war, and what the
horrors of it were. The farmers rode to market, sold their
sheep and cattle, returned sober or otherwise according to
force of habit, just as at usual times. In the village bordering
Windyhough the smith worked at his bellows, the cobbler
was busy as ever with making boots and scandal, the labourers&#8217;
wives&mdash;the shiftless sort&mdash;scolded their husbands into the
ale-house, while the more prudent ones made cheery hearths
for them at home. It seemed incredible that before the year
was out there would be such a fire kindled in this peaceful
corner of the world as might burn homesteads down, and
leave children fatherless, if things went amiss with Prince
Charles Edward.</p>

<p>But Sir Jasper let no doubts stay long with him. Things
would go well. If the risks were great, so was the recompense.
A Stuart safely on the throne again; English gentlemen
filling high places where foreigners were now in favour;
the English tongue heard frequently at Court; a return of the
days when Church and King meant more than an idle toast&mdash;surely
the prize was worth the hazard.</p>

<p>He carried a sore heart on his own account these days.
He had a wife and sons at Windyhough; he loved the house
that had grown old in company with his race; he had no personal
gain in this adventure of the Prince&#8217;s, no need of recompense
nor wish for it; and sometimes, when he was tired-out
or when he had found the younger gentry irresolute in
face of the instant call to arms, he grew weak and foolish,
as if he needed to learn from the everlasting hills about him
that he was human after all. And at these times his faith
shone low and smoky, like a fire that needs a keen breath of
wind to kindle it afresh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>On one of these days, near dusk, as he rode home across the
moor, dispirited because no news had followed Oliphant&#8217;s message
of a week ago, a rider overtook him at a spurring gallop,
checked suddenly, and turned in saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was for Windyhough,&#8221; he panted. &#8220;You&#8217;ve saved me
three miles, sir&mdash;and, gad! my horse will bless you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The news, Oliphant? The news? I&#8217;m wearying for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be ready within the week. The Prince is into Annan&mdash;Carlisle
will fall&mdash;get your men and arms together. Pass on
the word to Squire Demaine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the signal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till I bring it, or another. Be ready, and&mdash;God save
the King!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here on the hilltops, while Oliphant of Muirhouse breathed
his horse for a moment, the two men looked, as honest folk
do, straight into each other&#8217;s eyes. Sir Jasper saw that Oliphant
was weary in the cause of well-doing; that was his trade
in life, and he pursued it diligently; but the older man was not
prepared for the sudden break and tenderness in the rider&#8217;s
voice as he broke off to cry &#8220;God save the King!&#8221; There
was no bravado possible up here, where sleety, austere hills
were the only onlookers; the world&#8217;s applause was far off,
and in any case Oliphant was too saddle-sore and hungry to
care for such light diet; yet that cry of his&mdash;resolute, gay almost&mdash;told
Sir Jasper that two men, here on the uplands, were
sharing the same faith.</p>

<p>&#8220;God save the King!&#8221; said Sir Jasper, uncovering; &#8220;and&mdash;Oliphant,
you&#8217;ll take a pinch of snuff with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant laughed&mdash;the tired man&#8217;s laugh that had great
pluck behind it&mdash;and dusted his nostrils with the air of one
who had known courts and gallantry. &#8220;They say it guards
a man against chills, Sir Jasper&mdash;and one needs protection of
that sort in Lancashire. Your men are warm and Catholic&mdash;but
your weather and your roads&mdash;de&#8217;il take them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our weather bred us, Oliphant. We&#8217;ll not complain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant of Muirhouse glanced at him. &#8220;By gad! you&#8217;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
tough, sir,&#8221; he said, with that rare smile of his which folk
likened to sun in midwinter frost.</p>

<p>&#8220;By grace o&#8217; God, I&#8217;m tough; but I never learned your
trick of hunting up tired folk along the roads and putting new
heart into them. How did you learn the trick, Oliphant?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was cold up here, and the messenger had need to get about
his business; but two men, sharing a faith bigger than the
hills about them, were occupied with this new intimacy that
lay between them, an intimacy that was tried enough to let
them speak of what lay nearest to their hearts. Oliphant
looked back along the years&mdash;saw the weakness of body, the
tired distrust of himself that had hindered him, the groping
forward to the light that glimmered faint ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, by misadventure and by sorrow&mdash;how else? I&#8217;ll take
another pinch of snuff, Sir Jasper, and ride forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they but knew, Oliphant!&#8221; The older man&#8217;s glance
was no less direct, but it was wistful and shadowed by some
doubt that had taken him unawares. &#8220;We&#8217;ve all to gain, we
loyalists, and George has left us little enough to lose. And
yet our men hang back. Cannot they see this Rising as I see
it? Prosperity and kingship back again&mdash;no need to have a
jug of water ready when you drink the loyal toast&mdash;the Maypole
reared again in this sour, yellow-livered England. Oliphant,
we&#8217;ve the old, happy view of things, and yet our gentlemen
hang back.&#8221;</p>

<p>A cloud crossed Oliphant&#8217;s persistent optimism, too. In
experience of men&#8217;s littleness, their shams and subterfuges
when they were asked to put bodily ease aside for sake of battle,
he was older than Sir Jasper. The night-riders of this
Rising saw the dark side, not only of the hilly roads they
crossed, but of human character; and in this corner of Lancashire
alone Oliphant knew to a nicety the few who would
rise, sanguine at the call of honour, and the many who would
add up gain and loss like figures in a tradesman&#8217;s ledger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Jasper,&#8221; he said, breaking an uneasy silence, &#8220;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Prince will come to his own with few or many. If it were
you and I alone, I think we&#8217;d still ride out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned from the saddle, gripped the other&#8217;s hand, and
spurred forward into the grey haze that was creeping up the
moor across the ruddy sundown.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper followed him, at an easier pace. For a while
he captured something of Oliphant&#8217;s zeal&mdash;a zeal that had
not been won lightly&mdash;and then again doubt settled on him,
cold as the mist that grew thicker and more frosty as he gained
the lower lands. He knew that the call had come which
could not be disobeyed, and he was sick with longing for the
things that had been endeared to him by long-continued peace.
There was Rupert, needing a father&#8217;s guidance, a father&#8217;s help
at every turn, because he was a weakling; he had not known
till now how utterly he loved the lad. There was his wife,
who was wayward and discontented these days; but he had
not forgotten the beauty of his wooing-time. There was all
to lose, it seemed, in spite of his brave words not long ago.</p>

<p>Resolute men feel these things no less&mdash;nay, more, perhaps&mdash;than
the easy-going. Their very hatred of weakness, of
swerving from the straight, loyal path, reacts on them, and
they find temptation doubly strong. Sir Jasper, as he rode
down into the nipping frost that hung misty about the chimney-stacks
below him, had never seen this house of his so
comely, so likeable. Temptation has a knack of rubbing out
all harsher lines, of showing a stark, midwinter landscape as
a land of plenty and of summer. There were the well ordered
life, the cheery greetings with farmer-folk and hinds who
loved their squire. There was his wife&mdash;she was young again,
as on her bridal-day, asking him if he dared leave her&mdash;and
there was his heir. Maurice, the younger-born, would go out
with the Rising; but Rupert must be left behind.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper winced, as if in bodily pain. Every impulse was
bidding him stay. Every tie, of home and lands and tenantry,
was pulling him away from strict allegiance to the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Cause. He had but to bide at home, to let the Rising sweep
by him and leave him safe in his secluded corner of the
moors; it was urgent that he should stay, to guard his wife
against the licence that might follow civil war; it was his
duty to protect his own.</p>

<p>The strength of many yesterdays returned to help Sir Jasper.
Because he was turned sixty, a light thinker might have
said that he might take his ease; but, because he was turned
sixty, he had more yesterdays behind him than younger men&mdash;days
of striving toward a goal as fixed as the pole-star,
nights of doubt and disillusion that had yielded to the dawn
of each succeeding sunrise. He had pluck and faith in God
behind him; and his trust was keen and bright, like the sword-blade
that old Andrew Ferrara had forged in Italy for Prince
Charles Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince needs me,&#8221; he muttered stubbornly. &#8220;That
should be praise enough for any man.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rode down the bridle-track to Windyhough; and the
nearer he got to the chimneys that were smoking gustily in the
shrewd east wind, the more he loved his homestead. It was
as if a man, living in a green oasis, were asked to go out across
the desert sands, because a barren, thirsty duty called him.</p>

<p>Again the patient yesterdays rallied to his aid. He shook
himself free of doubts, as a dog does when he comes out
of cold waters; and he took a pinch of snuff, and laughed.
&#8220;After all, I was growing fat and sleepy,&#8221; he thought,
stooping to pat the tired horse that carried him. &#8220;One can
sleep and eat too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>He found Lady Royd in the hall, waiting for him, and
a glance at her face chilled all desire to tell her the good
Rising news.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the trouble, wife?&#8221; he asked, with sudden foreboding.
&#8220;Is Rupert ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>She stamped her foot, and her face, comely at usual times,
was not good to see. &#8220;Oh, it is Rupert with you&mdash;and
always Rupert&mdash;till I lose patience. He is&mdash;why, just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
scholar. He does not hunt; he scarce dares to ride&mdash;we&#8217;ll
have to make a priest of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are worse callings,&#8221; broke in Sir Jasper, with the
squared jaw that she knew by heart, but would not understand.
&#8220;If my soul were clean enough for priesthood, I
should no way be ashamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but the lands? Will you not understand that he
is the heir&mdash;and there must be heirs to follow? We have
but two, and you&#8217;re taking Maurice to this mad rising that
can only end on Tower Hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is as God wills, wife o&#8217; mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she stamped her foot. &#8220;You&#8217;re in league together,
you and he.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We share the same Faith,&#8221; he put in dryly, &#8220;if that is to
be in league together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only to-day&mdash;an hour before you came&mdash;I found him
mooning in the library, when he should have been out of
doors. &#8216;Best join the priests at once, and have done with
it,&#8217; said I. And &#8216;No,&#8217; he answered stubbornly, &#8216;I&#8217;ve been
reading what the Royds did once. They fought for Charles
the First, and afterwards&mdash;they died gladly, some of them.
I come of a soldier-stock, and I need to fight.&#8217; The scholar
dreamed of soldiery! I tapped him on the cheek&mdash;and he a
grown man of five-and-twenty&mdash;and&#8221;&mdash;she halted, some hidden
instinct shaming her for the moment&mdash;&#8220;and he only
answered that he knew the way of it all&mdash;by books&mdash;dear
heart, by books he knew how strong men go to battle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rupert said that?&#8221; asked Sir Jasper gently. &#8220;Gad!
I&#8217;m proud of him. He&#8217;ll come to soldiery one day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By mooning in the library&mdash;by roaming the moors at all
hours of the day and night&mdash;is that the way men learn
to fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper was cool and debonair again. &#8220;Men learn to
fight as the good God teaches them, my lady. We have no
part in that. As for Rupert&mdash;I tell you the lad is staunch
and leal. He was bred a Christian gentleman, after all, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
breed tells&mdash;it tells in the long run, Agnes, though all the
fools in Lancashire go making mouths at Rupert.&#8221;</p>

<p>He strode up and down the hall, with the orderly impatience
that she knew. And then he told the Rising news;
and she ran towards him, and could not come too close
into his arms, and made confession, girlish in its simplicity,
that she, who cared little for her son, loved her husband better
than her pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not go? It is a mad Rising&mdash;here with the
Georges safe upon the throne. You need not go, at your
age. Let younger men bear the brunt of it, if they&#8217;ve a
mind for forlorn hopes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put her arms away from him, though it helped and
heartened him to know that, in some queer way, she loved
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any age one serves the Prince, wife. I&#8217;m bidden&mdash;that
is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd glanced keenly at her husband. She had been
spoilt and wilful, counting wealth and ease as her goal in
life; but she was sobered now. Sir Jasper had said so
little; but in his voice, in the look of his strong, well-favoured
face, there was something that overrode the shams of this
world. He was a simple-minded gentleman, prepared for
simple duty; and, because she knew that he was unbreakable,
her old wilfulness returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;For my sake, stay!&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;You are&mdash;my dear,
you do not know how much you are to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held her at arm&#8217;s length, looking into her face. Her
eyes were pixie-like&mdash;radiant, full of sudden lights and fugitive,
light-falling tears. So had he seen her, six-and-twenty
years before, when he brought her as a bride to Windyhough.
For the moment he was unnerved. She was so young in her
blandishment, so swift and eager a temptation. It seemed
that, by some miracle, they two were lad and lass again,
needing each other only, and seeing the world as a vague and
sunlit background to their happiness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;ll not go!&#8221; she said softly. &#8220;I knew you would
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not go?&#8221; He stood away from her, crossed to the window
that gave him a sight of the last sunset-red above the
heath. &#8220;You are childish, Agnes,&#8221; he said sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;So are all women, when&mdash;when they care. I need you
here&mdash;need you&mdash;and you will not understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper laughed, with a gentleness, a command of himself,
that did not date from yesterday. &#8220;And a man, when
he cares&mdash;he cares for his honour first&mdash;because it is his
wife&#8217;s. Agnes, you did not hear me, surely. I said that
the Prince commands me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>I</i> command you. Choose between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her tone was harsh. She had not known how frankly and
without stint she loved this man. She was looking ahead,
seeing the forlornness of the waiting-time while he was absent
on a desperate venture.</p>

<p>He came and patted her cheek, as if she were a baby to
be soothed. &#8220;I choose both,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Honour and you&mdash;dear
heart, I cannot disentangle them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt dwarfed by the breadth and simplicity of his appeal.
The world thought her devout, a leal daughter of
the Church; but she had not caught his gift of seeing each
day whole, complete, without fear or favour from the morrow.
And, because she was a spoilt child, she could not
check her words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve not seen the Prince. He&#8217;s a name only, while
I&mdash;I am your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper was tired with the long day&#8217;s hunting, the news
that had met him by the way; but his voice was quiet and
resolute. &#8220;He is more than a name, child. He&#8217;s my
Prince&mdash;and one day, if I live to see it, his father will be
crowned in London. And you&#8217;ll be there, and I shall tell
them that it was you, Agnes, who helped me fasten on my
sword-belt.&#8221;</p>

<p>And still she would not heed. Her temperament was of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the kind that afterwards was to render the whole Rising
barren. She had no patience and little trust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I give you God-speed to Tower Hill?&#8221; she
snapped. &#8220;You think the name of Stuart is one to conjure
with. You think all Lancashire will rise, when this
wizard Prince brings the Stuart Rose to them. Trust me&mdash;I
know how Lancashire will wait, and wait; they are cautious
first and loyal afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lancashire will rise,&#8221; broke in Sir Jasper; &#8220;but, either
way, I go&mdash;and all my tenantry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your heir? He will go, too, will he not?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not know how deep her blow struck. He had
resisted her, her passionate need of him. He would leave her
for a Rising that had no hope of success, because the name
of Stuart was magical to him. In her pain and loneliness
she struck blindly.</p>

<p>He went to the door, threw it open, and stood looking at
the grey, tranquil hills. There was the sharp answer ready
on his tongue. He checked it. This was no time to yield to
anger; for the Prince&#8217;s men, if they were to win home to
London, had need of courage and restraint.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son&#8221;&mdash;he turned at last, and his voice was low and
tired&mdash;&#8220;<i>our</i> son, Agnes&mdash;he is not trained for warfare. I
tell you, he&#8217;ll eat his heart out, waiting here and knowing
he cannot strike a blow. His heart is big enough, if only
the body of him would give it room.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was desperate. All the years of selfishness, with Sir
Jasper following every whim for love of her, were prompting
her to keep him at her apron-strings. Her own persuasion
had failed; she would try another way, though it hurt her
pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll eat his heart out, as you say. Then stay for the
boy&#8217;s sake,&#8221; she put in hurriedly. &#8220;He will feel the shame
of being left behind&mdash;he will miss you at every turn&mdash;it is
cruel to leave him fatherless.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had tempted him in earnest now. He stood moodily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
at the door, watching the hills grow dark beneath a sky of
velvet grey. He knew the peril of this Rising&mdash;knew that
the odds were heavy against his safe return&mdash;and the pity
of that one word &#8220;fatherless&#8221; came home to him. This
weakling of his race had not touched compassion in the
mother, as the way of weaklings is; but he had moved his
father to extreme and delicate regard for him, had threaded
the man&#8217;s hardihood and courage with some divine and silver
streak.</p>

<p>He turned at last. There was something harsh, repellent
in his anger, for already he was fighting against dreary
odds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get to your bed, wife! Fatherless? He&#8217;d be worse
than that if I sat by the fireside after the Prince had bidden
me take the open. He&#8217;d live to hear men say I was a coward&mdash;he&#8217;d
live to wish the hills would tumble down and hide
him, for shame of his own father. God forgive you, Agnes,
but you&#8217;re possessed of a devil to-night&mdash;just to-night, when
the wives of other men are fastening sword-belts on.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the stormy prelude to a fast and hurrying week.
Messengers rode in, by night and day, with news from
Scotland. They rode with hazard; but so did the gentlemen
of Lancashire, whenever they went to fair or market, and
listened to the rider&#8217;s message, and glanced about to see if
George&#8217;s spies were lingering close to them.</p>

<p>Men took hazards, these days, as unconcernedly as they
swallowed breakfast before getting into saddle. Peril was
part of the day&#8217;s routine, and custom endeared it to them,
till love of wife and home grew like a garden-herb, that
smells the sweetest when you crush it down.</p>

<p>Lady Royd watched her husband&#8217;s face, and saw him grow
more full of cheeriness as the week went on. Oliphant&#8217;s
news had been true enough, it seemed, for Scotland had
proved more than loyal, and had risen at the Stuart&#8217;s call
as a lass comes to her lover. The Highlanders had sunk
their quarrels with the Lowlanders, and the ragged beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of an army was already nearing Carlisle. Then there
came a morning when Sir Jasper rode into the nearest town
on market-day, and moved innocent and farmer-like among
the thick-thewed men who sold their pigs and cattle, and
halted now and then to snatch news of the Rising from some
passer-by who did not seem, in garb or bearing, to be concerned
with Royal business; and he returned to Windyhough
with the air of one who has already come into his
kingdom.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are at Carlisle, wife,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve taken
the Castle there&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no news to Carlisle Castle, that,&#8221; she broke in&mdash;shrewishly,
because she loved him and feared to let him go.
&#8220;It stands there to be taken, if you&#8217;ve taught me my history&mdash;first
by the Scots, and the next day by the English.
Carlisle is a wanton, by your leave, that welcomes any man&#8217;s
attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had come home to meet east wind and littleness&mdash;the
spoilt woman&#8217;s littleness, that measures faith by present and
immediate gains. He was chilled for the moment; but the
loyalty that had kept him hale and merry through sixty
years was anchored safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince comes south, God bless him!&#8221; he said
gravely. &#8220;We shall go out at dawn one of these near days,
Agnes. We shall not wait for his coming&mdash;we shall ride
out to meet him, and give him welcome into loyal Lancashire.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was not shrewish now. Within the narrow walls she
had built about her life she loved him, as a garden-flower
loves the sun, not asking more than ease and shelter. And
her sun was telling her that he must be absent for awhile,
leaving her in the cold, grey twilight that women know
when their men ride out to battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not go,&#8221; she said, between her tears. &#8220;Dear,
the need I have of you&mdash;the need&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stooped suddenly and kissed her on the cheek. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
should love you less, my dear, if I put slippers on at home
and feared to take the open.&#8221;</p>

<p>And still she would not answer him, or look him in the
eyes with the strength that husbands covet when they are
bent on sacrifice and need a staff to help them on the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not the lover that you were&mdash;say, more years ago
than I remember,&#8221; she said with a last, soft appeal.</p>

<p>He laughed, and touched her hand as a wooer might. &#8220;I
love you twice as well, little wife. You&#8217;ve taught me how
to die, if need be.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came through the door of the garden that had sheltered
her. For the first time in her life she met the open
winds; and Sir Jasper&#8217;s trust in her was not misplaced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the love you&#8217;ve hidden all these years?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear. It&#8217;s the love you had always at command,
if you had known it. Men are shy of talking of such matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran to get his sword, docile as a child, and laid it on
the table. &#8220;I shall buckle it on for you, never fear,&#8221; she
said, with the light in her eyes at last&mdash;the light he had
sought and hungered for.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sweetheart, you&mdash;you care, then, after all?&#8221; He kissed
her on the lips this time. &#8220;We shall go far together, you
and I, in the Prince&#8217;s cause. Women sit at home, and pray&mdash;and
their men fight the better for it. My dear, believe me,
they fight the better for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They faced each other, searching, as wind-driven folk do,
for the larger air that cleanses human troubles. And suddenly
she understood how secure was the bond that intimacy
had tied about them. She had not guessed it till she came
from her sheltered garden and faced the breezy hills of Lancashire
at last.</p>

<p>And her husband, seeing her resolute, allowed himself a
moment&#8217;s sickness, such as he had felt not long ago after
saying good-bye to Oliphant high up the moor. He might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not return. The odds were all against it. He was bidding
a last farewell, perhaps, to the ordered life here, the lover&#8217;s
zeal which his wife commanded from him still&mdash;to the son
whom he had watched from babyhood, waiting always, with a
father&#8217;s dogged hope, for signs of latent strength. In some
queer way he thought most of his boy just now; the lad was
lonely, and needed him.</p>

<p>Then he crushed the sickness down. The night&#8217;s road was
dark and troublesome; but, whether he returned or no, there
must needs be a golden end to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it matter, wife?&#8221; he said, his voice quivering
a little. &#8220;A little loneliness&mdash;in any case it would not
be for long, sweetheart&mdash;and then&mdash;why, just that the Prince
had called me, and we had answered, you and I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She swept round on him in a storm of misery and doubt.
&#8220;Oh, Faith&#8217;s good enough in time of Peace. Women cherish
it when days go easily, and chide their men for slackness.
And the call comes&mdash;and then, God help us! we cling
about your knees while you are resolute. It is the men who
have true faith&mdash;the faith that matters and that helps them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her face into his two hands. She remembered
that he had worn just this look, far off in the days of lavender
and rosemary, when he had brought her home a bride
to Windyhough and had kissed her loneliness away.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s to fear? War or peace&mdash;what&#8217;s to fear?
We&#8217;re not children, wife o&#8217; mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>And &#8220;No!&#8221; she said, with brave submissiveness. And
then again her face clouded with woe, and tenderness, and
longing, as when hill-mists gather round the sun. &#8220;Ah, but
yes!&#8221; she added petulantly. &#8220;We are like children&mdash;like children
straying in the dark. You see the Prince taking London,
with skirl of the pipes and swinging Highland kilts.
<i>I</i> see you kneeling, husband, with your head upon the
block.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper laughed quietly, standing to his full, brave
height. &#8220;And either way it does not matter, wife&mdash;so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
as the Prince has need of me. You&#8217;ll find me kneeling, one
way or the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the shadowed hall, with the candles flickering in the
sconces, their son came out into the open&mdash;their son, who
could not go to war because he was untrained. He had been
listening to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I must ride with you. Indeed, I cannot
stay at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper answered hastily, as men will when they stand
in the thick of trouble. &#8220;What, you? You cannot, lad.
Your place is here, as I told you&mdash;to guard your mother and
Windyhough.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad winced, and turned to seek the shadows again,
after one long, searching glance at the other&#8217;s unrelenting
face. And Lady Royd forgot the past. She followed him,
brought him back again into the candlelight. One sharp
word from the father had bidden her protect this son who
was bone of her bone. Rupert looked at her in wonder.
She had been his enemy till now; yet suddenly she was his
friend.</p>

<p>He looked gravely at her&mdash;a man of five-and-twenty, who
should have known better than to blurt out the deeper
thoughts that in prudent folk lie hidden. &#8220;Mother,&#8221; he said,
striving to keep the listless, care-naught air that was his
refuge against the day&#8217;s intrusions&mdash;&#8220;mother&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She had not heard the word before&mdash;not as it reached her
now&mdash;because she had not asked for it. It was as if she
had lived between four stuffy walls, fearing to go out into
the gladness and the pain of motherhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, boy?&#8221; she asked, with lover-like impatience for the
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are kind to&mdash;to pity me. But it seems to make it
harder,&#8221; he said with extreme simpleness. &#8220;I&#8217;m no son to
be proud of, mother.&#8221; His voice was low, uncertain, as he
looked from one to the other of these two who had brought
him into a troubled world.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>Then he glanced shyly at his father. &#8220;I could die, sir,
for the Prince,&#8221; he added, with a touch of humour. &#8220;But
they say I cannot live for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wife looked at the husband. And pain crossed between
them like a fire. He was so big of heart, this lad,
and yet he was left stranded here in the backwater of life.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper laid a hand on his shoulder. &#8220;You&#8217;re no fool,
Rupert,&#8221; he said, fierce in his desire to protect the lad from
his own shame. &#8220;I give you the post of honour, after all&mdash;to
guard your mother. We cannot all ride afield, and I&#8217;m
leaving some of our men with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Rupert; &#8220;you leave the lamesters, father&mdash;the
men who are past service, whose joints are crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was bitter. This Rising had fired his chivalry, his
dreams of high adventure, his race-instinct for a Stuart and
the Cause. He had dreamed of it during these last, eager
nights, had freed himself from day-time weakness, and had
ridden out, a leader, along the road that led through Lancashire
to London. And the end of it was this&mdash;he was to
be left at home, because straight-riding men were hindered
by the company of an untrained comrade.</p>

<p>The father saw it all. He had not watched this son of his
for naught through five-and-twenty years of hope that he
would yet grow strong enough to prove himself the fitting
heir. It was late, and Sir Jasper had to make preparation
for a ride to market at dawn; but he found time to spare
for Rupert&#8217;s needs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me, Rupert,&#8221; he said, putting an arm through
his son&#8217;s. &#8220;It was always in my mind that Windyhough
might be besieged, and I leave you here&mdash;in command, you
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In command?&#8221; Rupert was alert, incredulous. &#8220;That
was the way my dreams went, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dreams come true, just time and time. You should
count it a privilege, my lad, to stay at home. It is easier to
ride out.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Lady Royd, as she watched them go arm-in-arm together
through the hall, was in agreement with her husband. It
was easier to ride out than to sit at home, as scholars and
women did, waiting emptily for news that, when it came,
was seldom pleasant. Already, though her husband had not
got to saddle, she was counting the hazards that were sure
to meet him on the road to London. And yet some sense
of comfort whispered at her ear. Her son was left behind
to guard her. She lingered on the thought, and with twenty
womanish devices she hedged it round, until at last she half
believed it. This boy of hers was to guard her. In her heart
she knew that the storm of battle would break far away from
Windyhough, that in the event of peril Rupert must prove
a slender reed; but she was yielding to impulse just now, and
felt the need to see her son a hero.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, meanwhile, was going from room to room of
the old house, from one half-forgotten stairway to another.
He showed Rupert how each window&mdash;old loopholes, most
of them, filled in with glass to fit modern needs&mdash;commanded
some useful outlook on an enemy attacking Windyhough.
He showed him the cellars, where the disused muskets and
the cannon lay, and the piles of leaden balls, and the kegs
of gunpowder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in command, remember,&#8221; he said now and then,
as they made their tour of the defences. &#8220;You must carry
every detail with you. You must be ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Sir Jasper all this was a fairy-tale he told&mdash;a clumsy
tale enough, but one designed to soften the blow to his heir;
to Rupert it was a trumpet-note that roused his sleeping
manhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it all by heart, father,&#8221; he said eagerly. Then he
glanced sharply at Sir Jasper. &#8220;No one ever&mdash;ever trusted
me till now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was trust I needed, maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper was ashamed. Looking at Rupert, with his
lean body, the face that was lit with strength and purpose, he
repented of the nursery-tale he had told him&mdash;the tale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
leadership, of an attack upon the house, of the part which one
poor scholar was asked to play in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up to bed, dear lad,&#8221; he said huskily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told
you all that need be. Sleep well, until you&#8217;re wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Rupert could not sleep. He was possessed by the
beauty of this hope that had wound itself, a silver thread,
through the drab pattern of his life. He let his father go
down into the hall, then followed, not wishing to play eavesdropper
again, but needing human comradeship.</p>

<p>Lady Royd, weaving dreams of her own downstairs,
glanced up as she heard her husband&#8217;s step.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you were kind to the boy,&#8221; she said, comelier since
she found her motherhood.</p>

<p>He put her aside. &#8220;I was not kind, wife. I lied to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a good cause, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; His fierceness shocked her; for until now she
had been unused to vehemence. &#8220;Lies never served a good
cause yet. I told him&mdash;God forgive me, Agnes!&mdash;that he
would be needed here. He has pluck, and this notion of
leadership&mdash;it went to his head like wine, and I felt as if I&#8217;d
offered drink to a lad whose head was too weak for honest
liquor.&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved restlessly about the hall. &#8220;Yet in the summer
you had kegs of gunpowder brought in,&#8221; she said by and
by&mdash;&#8220;under the loaded hay-wagons, you remember, lest
George&#8217;s spies were looking on?&#8221;</p>

<p>There would be little room for tenderness in the days that
were coming, and, perhaps for that reason, Sir Jasper drew
his wife toward him now. He was thinking of the haytime,
of the last load brought in by moonlight, of the English
strength and fragrance of this country life to which he was
saying good-bye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wooed you in haytime, Agnes, and married you when
the men were bending to their scythes the next year, and
we brought the gunpowder in at the like season. We&#8217;ll take it
for an omen.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; she murmured, with remembrance of her son&mdash;the
son who was the firstfruit of their wooing&mdash;&#8220;you
said that you had lied to Rupert when you bade him guard
the house. Why bring in gunpowder, except to load your
muskets with?&#8221;</p>

<p>He sighed impatiently. This parting from the wife and
son grew drearier the closer it approached. &#8220;We had other
plans in the summer. It was to be a running fight, we
thought, from Carlisle down through Lancashire. Every
manor was to be held as a halting-place when the Prince&#8217;s
army needed rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crossed to the big western window of the hall, and
stood looking up at the moonlit, wintry hills. Then he turned
again, not guessing that his son was standing in the shadows
close at his right hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Other counsels have prevailed,&#8221; he said, with the snappishness
of a man who sees big deeds awaiting him and
doubts his human strength. &#8220;I think the Prince did not
know, Agnes, how slow we are to move in Lancashire&mdash;how
quick to strike, once we&#8217;re sure of the road ahead. Each
manor that held out for the King&mdash;it would have brought
a hundred doubters to the Cause; the army would have felt
its way southward, growing like a snowball as it went. They
say the Prince overruled his counsellors. God grant that he
was right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So there&#8217;s to be no siege of Windyhough?&#8221; asked Lady
Royd slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;None that I can see. It is to be a flying charge on London.
The fighting will be there, or in the Midlands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is good hearing, so far as anything these days can
be called good hearing. Suppose your lie had prospered,
husband? Suppose Rupert had had to face a siege in earnest
here? Oh, I&#8217;ve been blind, but now I&mdash;I understand the
shame you would have put on him, when he was asked to
hold the house and could not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He could!&#8221; snapped Sir Jasper. &#8220;I&#8217;ve faith in the lad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
I tell you. A Royd stands facing trouble always when the
pinch comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him wistfully, with a sense that he was years
older than herself in steadiness, years younger in his virile
grip on faith. It was an hour when danger and the coming
separation made frank confession easy. &#8220;I share your
Faith,&#8221; she said quietly, &#8220;but I&#8217;m not devout as you are.
Oh, miracles&mdash;they happened once, but not to-day. This boy
of ours&mdash;can you see him holding Windyhough against
trained soldiery? Can you hear him sharp with the word of
command?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the other, with the simplicity of trust. &#8220;If the
need comes, he will be a Royd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, you cannot believe it! I, who long to, cannot.
No leader ever found his way&mdash;suddenly&mdash;without preparation&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No miracle was ever wrought in that way,&#8221; he broke in,
with the quiet impatience of one who knows the road behind,
but not the road ahead. &#8220;There are no sudden happenings
in this life&mdash;and I&#8217;ve trained the lad&#8217;s soul to leadership. I
would God that I&#8217;d not lied to him to-night&mdash;I would that
the siege could come in earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert crept silently away, down the passage, and through
the hall, and out into the night. Through all his troubles
he had had one strength to lean upon&mdash;his father&#8217;s trust and
comradeship. And now that was gone. He had heard Sir
Jasper talk of the siege as of a dream-toy thrown to him to
play with. In attack along the London road, or in defence
at home, he was untrained, and laughable, and useless.</p>

<p>There was war in his blood as he paced up and down the
courtyard. His one ally had deserted him, had shown him
a tender pity that was worse to bear than ridicule. He stood
alone, terribly alone, in a world that had no need of him.</p>

<p>The wind came chill and fretful from the moor, blowing a
light drift of sleet before it; and out of the lonely land a sudden
hope and strength reached out to him. It was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
breed of him, deep under his shyness and scholarly aloofness,
this instinct to stand at his stiffest when all seemed lost. He
would stay at home. He would forget that he had overheard
his father&#8217;s confession of a lie, would get through each
day as it came, looking always for an attack that, by some
unexpected road, might reach the gates of Windyhough.</p>

<p>But there was another task he had&mdash;to forgive Sir Jasper
for the make-believe&mdash;and this proved harder. Forgiveness
is no easy matter to achieve; it cannot be feigned, or hurried,
or find root in shallow soil; it comes by help of blood
and tears, wayfaring together through the dark night of a
man&#8217;s soul.</p>

<p>Rupert went indoors at last, and met Sir Jasper at the
stairfoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, lad, I thought you were in bed long since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not rest indoors, sir. I&mdash;I needed room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all of the same breed,&#8221; laughed his father.
&#8220;House-walls never yet helped a man to peace. Good-night,
my lad&mdash;and remember you&#8217;re on guard here.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE LOYAL MEET</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> days later Sir Jasper and Maurice sat at breakfast.
There was a meet of hounds that morning, and, because the
hour was early, Lady Royd was not down to share the meal.
It was cold enough after full sunrise, she was wont to say,
with her lazy, laughing drawl, and not the most devoted wife
could be expected to break her fast by candlelight.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, for his part, ate with appetite this morning.
The unrest of the past weeks had been like a wind from the
north to him, sharpening his vigour, driving out the little
weaknesses and doubts bred of long inaction. And, as he
ate, old Simon Foster, his man-of-all-work, opened the door
and put in the grizzled head which reminded his master always
of a stiff broom that had lately swept the snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Maister Oliphant,&#8221; said Simon gruffly. &#8220;Must
I let him in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed you must,&#8221; laughed Oliphant, putting him aside
and stepping into the room. &#8220;My business will not wait,
Sir Jasper, though Simon here is all for saying that it crosses
you to be disturbed at breakfast-time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men glanced quickly at each other. &#8220;You&#8217;re
looking in need of a meal yourself, Oliphant. Sit down, man,
and help us with this dish of devilled kidneys.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant, long ago, had learned to take opportunity as it
came; and meals, no less than his chances of passing on the
messages entrusted to him, were apt to prove haphazard and
to be seized at once. Old Simon, while they ate, hovered up
and down the room, eager for the news, until his master dismissed
him with a curt &#8220;You may leave us, Simon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simon obeyed, but he closed the door with needless violence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and they could hear him clattering noisily down the
passage, as if he washed his hands of the whole Rising business.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You may leave us, Simon!</i>&#8221; he growled. &#8220;That&#8217;s all
Sir Jasper has to say, after I&#8217;m worn to skin and bone in
serving him. And he must know by this time, surely, that
he allus gets into scrapes unless I&#8217;m nigh-handy, like, to
advise him what to do. Eh, well, maisters is maisters, and
poor serving-men is serving-men, and so &#8217;twill be till th&#8217; end
o&#8217; the chapter, I reckon. But I wish I knew what Maister
Oliphant rade hither-till to tell Sir Jasper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant looked across at his host, after Simon&#8217;s heavy
footfalls told them he was out of earshot. &#8220;The hunt comes
this way, Sir Jasper, with hounds in full cry. I see you&#8217;re
dressed for the chase.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And have been since&mdash;since I was breeked, I think.
When, Oliphant? It seems too good to be true. All
Lancashire is asking when, and I&#8217;m tired of telling
them to bide until they hear Tally-ho go sounding up the
moors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You start at dawn to-morrow. Ride into Langton, and
wait till you see the hounds in full view.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the scent&mdash;how does it lie, Oliphant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keen and true, sir. I saw one near the Throne three days
ago, and he said that he had never known a blither hunting-time.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had talked in guarded terms till now&mdash;the terms of
Jacobite freemasonry; but Sir Jasper&#8217;s heart grew too full
on the sudden for tricks of speech. &#8220;God bless him!&#8221; he
cried, rising to the toast. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be a second Restoration
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice, his face recovered from traces of the fight with
his stubborn brother, had been abashed a little by Oliphant&#8217;s
coming, for, like Rupert, he had the gift of hero-worship.
But now he, too, got to his feet, and his face was full of boyish
zeal. &#8220;We&#8217;ll hunt that fox of yours, Mr. Oliphant,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
laughed&mdash;&#8220;ay, as far as the sea. We&#8217;ll make him swim&mdash;over
the water, where our toasts have gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s bred true to the old stock, Sir Jasper,&#8221; laughed
Oliphant. &#8220;I wish every loyalist in Lancashire had sons
like Maurice here to bring with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper found no answer. An odd sadness crossed his
face, showing lines that were graven deeper than Oliphant
had guessed. &#8220;Come, we shall be late for the meet,&#8221; he said
gruffly. &#8220;Oliphant, do you stay and rest yourself here, or
will you ride with us? The meet is at Easterfield to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as the cross-roads, then. My way lies into Langton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant&#8217;s tone was curt as his host&#8217;s, for he was puzzled
by this sudden coolness following his praise of Maurice. As
they crossed the courtyard to the stables he saw Sir Jasper
glance up at the front of the house, and there, at an upper
window, Rupert the heir was watching stronger men
ride out to hunt the fox. He saw the misery in the lad&#8217;s
face, the stubborn grief in the father&#8217;s, and a new page was
turned for him in that muddled book of life which long
night-riding had taught him to handle with tender and extreme
care.</p>

<p>At the cross-ways they parted. All had been arranged
months since; the proven men in Lancashire, as in other
counties, were known to the well-wishers of the Prince.
Each had his part allotted to him, and Sir Jasper&#8217;s was to
rally all his hunting intimates. So far as preparation went,
this campaign of the Stuart against heavy odds had been
well served. The bigger work&mdash;the glad and instant wish
of every King&#8217;s man to rally to the call, forgetting ease of
body, forgetting wives and children&mdash;was in the making, and
none knew yet what luck would go with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;At Langton to-morrow,&#8221; said Oliphant, over-shoulder, as
he reined about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, God willing&mdash;and, after Langton, such a fire lit as
will warm London with its flames.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>When they got to Easterfield, Maurice and his father, the
sun was shining on a street of melting snow, following a quick
and rainy thaw, on well-groomed men and horses, on hounds
eager to be off on the day&#8217;s business. And, as luck had it,
they found a game fox that took them at a tearing gallop,
five miles across the wet and heavy pastures, before they
met a check.</p>

<p>The check lasted beyond the patience of the hunters, and
Sir Jasper chose his moment well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, rising in his stirrups&mdash;&#8220;gentlemen,
the meet is at my house of Windyhough to-morrow. Who
rides with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The field gathered round him. He was a man commanding
men, and he compelled attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;What meet?&#8221; asked Squire Demaine, his ruddy face
brick-red with sudden hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Loyal Meet. Who&#8217;s with me, gentlemen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper was strung to that pitch of high endeavour
which sees each face in a crowd and knows what impulse
sways it. They gathered round him to a man; but as he
glanced from one to the other he knew that there were many
waverers. For loyalty, free and unswerving, sets a light
about a man&#8217;s face that admits no counterfeit.</p>

<p>Yet the din was loud enough to promise that all were of one
mind here. Hounds and fox and huntsmen were forgotten.
Men waved their hats and shouted frantically. Nance Demaine
and the half-dozen ladies who were in the field to-day found
little kerchiefs and waved them, too, and were shrill and sanguine
in their cries of &#8220;The Prince, God bless him!&mdash;the
Prince!&mdash;the Stuart home again!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was all like Bedlam, while the austere hills, lined here
and there with snow that would not melt, looked down on
this warmth of human enterprise. The horses reared and
fidgeted, dismayed by the uproar. Hounds got out of hand
and ran in and out between the plunging hoofs, while the
huntsman, a better fox-hunter than King&#8217;s man, swore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
roundly and at large as he tried to bring them out of this outrageous
riot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Will Underwood?&#8221; asked a youngster suddenly.
It was young Hunter of Hunterscliff, whose lukewarmness
had angered Nance not long ago. &#8220;It&#8217;s the first meet he&#8217;s
missed this winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>A horseman at his elbow laughed, the laugh that men understood.
&#8220;He had business in the south, so he told me
when I met him taking the coach. Wild Will, from the look
of his face, seemed tired of hunting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Sir Jasper sharply. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have no man condemned
without a hearing. He lives wide of here&mdash;perhaps
this last news of the Rising has not reached him. Any man
may be called away on sudden business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re generous, sir. I&#8217;m hot for the King, and no
other business in the world would tempt me out of Lancashire
just now. Besides, he must have known.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance had lost her high spirits; but she was glad that some
one had spoken on Will Underwood&#8217;s behalf, for otherwise
she must have yielded to the impulse to defend him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That does not follow, sir,&#8221; said Sir Jasper, punctilious
in defence of a man he neither liked nor trusted. &#8220;At any
rate, it is no time for accusation. Mr. Underwood, if I know
him, will join us farther south.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Hunter, a wayward, unlicked cub, would not keep
silence. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, in his thin, high-pitched voice, &#8220;he&#8217;ll
join us as far south as London&mdash;after he&#8217;s sure that a Stuart&#8217;s
on the throne again.&#8221;</p>

<p>An uneasy silence followed. Older men looked at older
men, knowing that they shared this boy&#8217;s easy summing-up
of Underwood&#8217;s motives. And Nance wondered that this
man, whom she was near to loving, had no friends here&mdash;no
friends of the loyal sort who came out into the open and
pledged their faith in him.</p>

<p>There was a game hound of the pack&mdash;a grey old hound
that, like the huntsman, was a keener fox-hunter than loyalist;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and, through all this uproar and confusion, through the
dismayed silence that followed, he had been nosing up and
down the pastures, finding a weak scent here, a false trail
there. And now, on the sudden, he lifted his grey head, and
his note was like a bugle-call. The younger hounds scampered
out from among the hoofs that had been playing dangerously
near them and gave full tongue as they swung down
the pastures.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper spurred forward. &#8220;Here&#8217;s an omen, friends,&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;The hunt is up in earnest. We shall kill, I tell
you! we shall kill!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a run that afterwards, when the fires of war died
down and all Lancashire was hunting once again in peace,
was talked of beside cottage hearths, on market-days when
squires and yeomen met for barter&mdash;was talked of wherever
keen, lusty men foregathered for the day&#8217;s business and for
gossip of the gallant yesterdays.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper led, with Squire Demaine close at his heels. It
seemed, indeed, the day of older folk; for away in front of
them, where the sterns of eager hounds waved like a frantic
sea, it was Pincher&mdash;grey, hefty, wise in long experience&mdash;that
kept the running.</p>

<p>Prince Charles Edward was forgotten, though he had need
of these gentlemen on the morrow. After all, with slighter
excuse, they might any one of them break their necks to-day
in pursuit of the lithe red fox that showed like a running
splash of colour far ahead. The day was enough for them,
with its rollicking hazards, its sense of sheer pace and well-being.</p>

<p>Down Littlemead Ings the fox led them, and up the hill
that bordered Strongstones Coppice. He sought cover in
the wood, but Pincher, with a buoyant, eager yell, dislodged
him; and for seven miles, fair or foul going, they followed
that racing blotch of red. There were fewer horsemen now,
but most of them kept pace, galloping hard behind Sir Jasper
and the Squire, who were riding neck for neck. The fox,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
as it happened, was in his own country again, after a sojourn
he regretted in alien pastures; and he headed straight
for the barren lands of rock and scanty herbage that lay up
the slopes of Rother Hill. The going was steep and slippery,
the scent cold, because snow was lying on these upper
lands; and the fox, who knew all this a little better than
Pincher, plunged through a snowdrift that hid the opening of
his favourite cave and knew himself secure. They could dig
him out from a burrow, but this cave was long and winding,
and all its quiet retreats were known to him.</p>

<p>Pincher, the grey, hefty hound, plunged his nose into the
snow, then withdrew it and began to whimper. He was
unused to this departure from the usual rules of fox-hunting;
the snow was wet and chilly, and touched, maybe, some
note of superstition common to hounds and hill-bred men.
Superstition, at any rate, or some grave feeling, was patent
in the faces of the riders. The huntsman, knowing the windings
of the cave as well as Reynard, gathered his pack.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d be lost for ever and a day, Sir Jasper,&#8221; he growled,
&#8220;if once they got into that cave. I followed it once for a
mile and a half myself, and then didn&#8217;t reach the end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper glanced at Squire Demaine, and found the same
doubt in his face. They had chosen this gallop as an augury,
and they had not killed. It is slight matters of this sort that
are apt constantly to turn the balance of big adventures, and
the two older men knew well enough how the waverers were
feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said Sir Jasper sharply, &#8220;we&#8217;re not like
children. There&#8217;s no omen in all this. I jested when I talked
of omens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By gad, yes!&#8221; sputtered the Squire, backing his friend
with a bluster that scarcely hid his own disquiet. &#8220;There&#8217;s
only one good omen for to-morrow, friends&mdash;a strong body,
a sound sword arm, and a leal heart for the King. We&#8217;ll
not go back to the nursery, by your leave, because a fox skulks
into hiding.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>There was a waving of three-cornered hats again, a murmur
of applause; but the note did not ring true and merry,
as it had done at the start of this wild gallop. The horses
were shivering in a bitter wind that had got up from behind
the hollows of the uplands. Grey-blue clouds crept round
about the sun and stifled him, and sleet began to fall. They
were children of the weather to a man, and to-morrow&#8217;s ride
for London and the Stuart took on the semblance of a Lenten
fast.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE HORSE THIEF</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Windyhough, Rupert had watched Sir Jasper and his
brother ride out to the hunt, had felt the old pang of jealousy
and helplessness. They were so hale and keen on the day&#8217;s
business; and he was not one of them.</p>

<p>He turned impatiently from the upper window, not guessing
that his father had carried the picture of his tired face
with him to the meet. With some thought of getting up into
the moor, to still his restlessness, he went down the stair and
out into the courtyard. Lady Royd, who had not lain easy
in her bed this morning, was standing there. Some stronger
call than luxury and well-being had bidden her get up and
steal into the windy, nipping air, to watch her men ride out.
She was late, as she was for all appointments, and some bitter
loneliness had taken hold of her when she found them gone.
She had never been one of these gusty, unswerving people
here in Lancashire, and their strength was as foreign to her
as their weaknesses. Until her marriage with the impulsive
northern lover who had come south to the wooing and had
captured her girl&#8217;s fancy, she had lived in the lowlands,
where breezes played for frolic only; and the bleakness of
these hills had never oppressed her as it did this morning.
She forgot the swift and magic beauty that came with the
late-won spring, forgot how every slope and dingle of this
northern country wakened under the sun&#8217;s touch, how the
stark and empty moor grew rich with colour, how blackbird
and lavrock, plover and rook and full-throated thrush made
music wild and exquisite under the blue, happy sky. For the
present, the wind was nipping; on the higher hill-crests snow
lay like a burial-shroud; her husband and the younger son she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
idolised were riding out to-morrow on a perilous road because
they had listened to that haunting, unhappy melody which all
the Stuarts had the gift of sounding.</p>

<p>Lady Royd could not see beyond. Her faith was colder
than the hills which frightened her, emptier than this winter-time
she hated. She had not once captured the quiet, resolute
note that sounded through her husband&#8217;s conduct of
affairs. Let the wind whistle its keenest under a black and
sullen sky, Sir Jasper knew that he was chilled, as she did;
but he knew, too, that summer would follow, blithe and full
of hay-scents, fuller, riper in warmth and well-being, because
the months of cold had fed its strength.</p>

<p>She chose to believe that he was playing with a fine, romantic
sense of drama, in following the Prince, that he was
sacrificing Maurice to the same misplaced zeal. Yet hour
by hour and day by day of their long companionship, he had
made it plain, to a comrade less unwilling, that he had followed
a road marked white at every milestone by a faith that
would not budge, an obedience to the call of honour that was
instinctive, instant, as the answer of a soldier to his commanding
officer. If all went amiss with this Rising, if he
gave his life for a lost cause, it did not matter greatly to Sir
Jasper; for he was sure that in one world or another, a little
sooner or a little later, he would see that Restoration whose
promise shone like the morning star above the staunch, unbending
hills of Lancashire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is to gain by it all?&#8221; murmured Lady Royd, shivering
as she drew her wrap about her. &#8220;When I&#8217;m widowed,
and Maurice has gone, too, to Tower Hill&mdash;shall I hate these
Stuart fools the less? It matters little who is king&mdash;so
little&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She heard Rupert&#8217;s step behind her, turned and regarded
him with that half-tolerant disdain which had stood to her for
motherhood. Not long ago she had felt a touch of some
divine compassion for him, had been astonished by the pain
and happiness that pity teaches; but the mood had passed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and he stood to her now as a simpleton so exquisite that he had
not strength even to follow the stupid creeds he cherished.
She was in no temper to spare him; he was a welcome butt on
which to vent her weariness of all things under the sun.</p>

<p>They looked at each other, silent, questioning. Big happenings
were in the making. The very air of Lancashire these
days was instinct with the coming troubles, and folk were
restless, ill-at-ease as moor-birds are when thunder comes beating
up against the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not my fault, mother,&#8221; said Rupert brusquely, as if
answering some plainly-spoken challenge. &#8220;If I had my
way, I&#8217;d be taking fences, too&mdash;but, then, I never had my
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd laughed gently&mdash;the frigid, easy laugh that Rupert
knew by heart. &#8220;A <i>man</i>,&#8221; she said, halting on the word&mdash;&#8220;a
man makes his way, if he&#8217;s to have it. The babies stay
at home, and blame the dear God because He will not let them
hunt like other men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert took fire on the sudden, as he had done not long
since when he had fought with his brother on the moor. Old
indignities were brought to a head. He did not know what
he said; but Lady Royd bent her head, as if a moorland
tempest beat about her. It seemed as if the whole unrest, the
whole passion and heedlessness, of the Stuart battle against
circumstance had gathered to a head in this wind-swept courtyard
of the old fighting house of Windyhough.</p>

<p>And the combatants were a spoilt wife on one hand, on
the other a scholar who had not yet found his road in life.
The battle should have given food for laughter; yet the scholar
wore something of his father&#8217;s dignity and spirit, and the
woman was slow to admit a mastery that pleased and troubled
her.</p>

<p>Again there was a silence. The east wind was piping
through and through the courtyard, and rain was falling; but
on the high moors there were drifts of snow that would not
yield to the gusty warmth. All was upset, disordered&mdash;rain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and snow, and wind, were all at variance, as if they shared
the unrest and the tumult of the times.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you hurt me, Rupert,&#8221; she said weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no right, mother,&#8221; he broke in, contrite. &#8220;Of
course I am the heir&mdash;and I was never strong, as you had
wished&mdash;and&mdash;and I spoke in heat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like your heat, boy,&#8221; she said unexpectedly. &#8220;Oh, you
were right, were right! You never had a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his hand on her arm&mdash;gently, as a lover or a courtier
might. &#8220;Maurice should have been the heir. It cannot
be helped, mother&mdash;but you&#8217;ve been kind to me through it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd was dismayed. Her husband had yielded to her
whims; the folk about her had liked her beauty, her easy,
friendly insolence, the smile which comes easily to women
who are spoilt and have luxury at command. She had been
sure of herself till now&mdash;till now, when the son she had made
light of was at pains to salve her conscience. He was a stay-at-home,
a weakling. There was no glamour attaching to
him, no riding-out to high endeavour among the men who were
making or were marring history. Yet now, to the mother&#8217;s
fancy, he was big of stature.</p>

<p>She yielded to a sharp, dismaying pity. &#8220;My dear,&#8221; she
said, with a broken laugh, &#8220;you talk like your father&mdash;like
your father when I like him most and disagree with his mad
view of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert went to bed that night&mdash;after his father and Maurice
had returned muddied from a hunt he had not shared, after
the supper that had found him silent and without appetite&mdash;with
a sense of keen and personal disaster that would not let
him sleep. Through all his dreams&mdash;the brave, unspoiled
dreams of boyhood&mdash;he had seen this Rising take its present
shape. His father&#8217;s teaching, his stealthy reading in the library
of books that could only better a sound Stuart faith, had
prepared him for the Loyal Meet that was to gather at
Windyhough with to-morrow&#8217;s dawn. But in his dreams he had
been a rider among loyal riders, had struck a blow here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
there for the Cause he had at heart. In plain reality, with the
wind sobbing round the gables overhead, he was not disciplined
enough to join the hunt. He was untrained.</p>

<p>Maurice shared his elder brother&#8217;s bedroom; and somewhere
in the dark hours before the dawn he heard Rupert start from
a broken sleep, crying that the Prince was in some danger and
needed him. Maurice was tired after the day&#8217;s hunting, and
knew that he must be up betimes; and a man&#8217;s temper at such
times is brittle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get to sleep, Rupert!&#8221; he growled. &#8220;The Prince will be
none the better for your nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert was silent. He knew it was true. No man would
ever be the better, he told himself, for the help of a dreamer
and a weakling. He heard his brother turn over, heard the
heavy, measured breathing. He had no wish for sleep, but
lay listening to the sleet that was driving at the window-panes.
It was bitter cold, and dark beyond belief. Whatever chanced
with the Prince&#8217;s march to London, there was something to
chill the stoutest faith in this night-hour before the dawn.
Yet the scholar chose this moment for a sudden hope, a
warmth of impulse and of courage. Down the sleety wind,
from the moors he loved, a trumpet-call seemed to ring sharp
and clear. And the call sounded boot-and-saddle.</p>

<p>He sprang from bed and dressed himself, halted to be sure
that Maurice was still sound asleep, felt his way through the
pitch-dark of the room until he reached the door. Then he
went down, unbarred the main door with gentle haste, and
stood in the windy courtyard. It was a wet night and a
stormy one on Windyhough Heights. Now and then the
moon ran out between the grey-black, scudding clouds and
lit a world made up of rain and emptiness.</p>

<p>And Rupert again heard the clear, urgent call. Slight of
body, a thing of small account set in the middle of this majestic
uproar of the heath, he squared his shoulders, looked
at the house-front, the fields, the naked, wind-swept coppices,
to which he was the heir.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>Old tradition, some instinct fathered by many generations,
rendered him greater than himself. &#8220;Get to saddle,&#8221; said the
voice at his ear; and he forgot that the ways of a horse were
foreign to him. He glanced once again at the heath, as if
asking borrowed strength, then crept like a thief toward
the stables.</p>

<p>It was near dawn now. The wind, tired out, had sunk to a
low, piping breeze. The moon shone high and white from a
sky cleared of all but the filmiest clouds; and over the eastern
hummocks of the moor lithe, palpitating streaks of rose, and
grey, and amber were ushering up the sun.</p>

<p>All was uproar in the stable-yard, and the future master of
these grooms and farm-lads waited in the shadows&mdash;a looker-on,
as always. He saw a lanthorn swinging up and down the
yard, confusing still more the muddled light of moon and
dawn; and then he heard Giles, his father&#8217;s bailiff, laugh as he
led out Sir Jasper&#8217;s horse, and listened while the man swore,
with many a rich Lancashire oath, that Rising work was better
than keeping books and harrying farmers when they would
not pay their rents. And still Rupert waited, watching sturdy
yeomen ride in from Pendle Forest, on nags as well built as
themselves, to answer Sir Jasper&#8217;s rally-call.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis only decent-like, Giles,&#8221; he heard one ruddy yeoman
say, &#8220;to ride in a little before our betters need us. I was never
one to be late at a hunt, for my part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It all gangs gradely,&#8221; Giles answered cheerily. &#8220;By
dangment, though, the dawn&#8217;s nearer than I thought; and I&#8217;ve
my own horse to saddle yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert waited with great patience for his chance&mdash;waited
until Giles came out again, leading a thick-set chestnut that
had carried him on many a bailiff&#8217;s errand. And in the waiting
his glow of courage and high purpose grew chilled. He
watched the lanthorns bobbing up and down the yard, watched
the dawn sweep bold and crimson over this crowd of busy
folk. He was useless, impotent; he had no part in action, no
place among these men, strong of their hands, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
getting ready for the battle. Yet, under all the cold and
shame, he knew that, if he were asked to die for the Cause&mdash;asked
simply, and without need to show himself a fool at
horsemanship&mdash;it would be an easy matter.</p>

<p>He looked on, and he was lonelier than in the years behind.
Until a day or two ago he had been sure of one thing
at least&mdash;of his father&#8217;s trust in him; and Sir Jasper had killed
that illusion when he taught his heir how Windyhough was to
be defended against attack and afterwards confessed that it
was a trick to soothe the lad&#8217;s vanity.</p>

<p>Yet still he waited, some stubborness of purpose behind him.
And by and by he saw his chance. The stable-yard was empty
for the moment. Sir Jasper&#8217;s men had mustered under the
house-front, waiting for their leader to come out. Giles had
left his own horse tethered to a ring outside the stable door,
while he led the master&#8217;s grey and Maurice&#8217;s slim, raking
chestnut into the courtyard. From the bridle-track below
came the clatter of hoofs, as Sir Jasper&#8217;s hunting intimates
brought in their followers to the Loyal Meet. On that side
of the house all was noise, confusion; on this side, the stable-yard
lay quiet under the paling moonlight and the ruddy, nipping
dawn.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper&#8217;s heir crossed the yard, as if he planned a theft
and feared surprisal. There had been horse-thieves among his
kin, doubtless, long ago when the Royds were founding a family
in this turbulent and lawless county; and Rupert was
but harking back to the times when necessity was the day&#8217;s
gospel.</p>

<p>He unslipped the bridle of Giles&#8217;s horse, and let him
through the gate that opened on the pastures at the rear of
Windyhough. Then he went in a wide circle round the
house, until he reached a wood of birch and rowan that stood
just above the Langton road. The wind was up again, and
rain with it; and in the downpour Rupert, holding the bridle
of a restive horse, waited for the active men to pass him by
along the road that led to Prince Charles Edward. He could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
not join them at the meet in the courtyard, but he would wait
here till they passed, he told himself, would get to saddle afterwards
and ride down and follow them. And in the coming
battle, may be, he would prove to his father that courage was
not lacking, after all, in the last heir of the Royd men.</p>

<p>The front of Windyhough, meanwhile, was busy with men
and horses, with sheep-dogs that had followed their masters,
unnoticed and unbidden, from the high farms that bordered
Windyhough. It might have been Langton market-day, so
closely and with such laughing comradeship yeomen, squires,
and hinds rubbed shoulders, while dogs ran in and out between
their legs and horses whinnied to each other. The
feudal note was paramount. There was no distrust here, no
jealousy of class against class; the squires were pledged to defend
those who followed them with healthy and implicit confidence,
their men were loyal in obedience that was neither
blind nor stupid, but trained by knowledge and the sense of
discipline, as a soldier&#8217;s is. Each squire was a kingly father
to the men he had gathered from his own acres. In all things,
indeed, this gathering at Windyhough was moved by the clan
spirit that had made possible the Prince&#8217;s gathering of an
army in Scotland&mdash;that small, ill-equipped army which had
already routed General Cope at Prestonpans, had compelled
Edinburgh to applaud its pluck and gallantry, had taken Carlisle
Castle, and now was marching through a country, disaffected
for the most part, on the forlornest hope that ever
bade men leave warm hearths.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, standing near the main door of Windyhough,
watched the little companies ride in. He was keen and buoyant,
and would not admit that he was troubled because his own
judgment and that of his friends was justified. He had
guessed that one in five of those who had passed their claret
over the water would prove their faith; and he had calculated
to a nicety. One whom he had counted a certain absentee was
here, to be sure&mdash;young Hunter of Hunterscliff, whose tongue
was more harum-scarum than his heart. But, against this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
gain of a sword-arm and a dozen men, he had to set Will Underwood&#8217;s
absence. Some easy liking for Will&#8217;s horsemanship,
some instinct to defend him against the common distrust,
had prompted him to an obstinate, half-hearted faith in the
man. Yet he was not here, and Sir Jasper guessed unerringly
what the business was that had taken him wide of Lancashire.</p>

<p>Squire Demaine was the last to ride in with his men. He
could afford to be late; for Pendle Hill, round and stalwart
up against the crimson, rainy sky, would as soon break away
from its moorings as Roger Demaine proved truant to his
faith.</p>

<p>It was wet and cold, and the errand of these men was not
one to promise warmth for many a day to come. Yet they
raised a cheer when old Roger pushed his big, hard-bitten
chestnut through the crowd. And when they saw that his
daughter was with him, riding the grey mare that had known
many a hunting morn, their cheers grew frantic. For at these
times men learn the way of their hearts, and know the folk
whose presence brings a sense of well-being.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper had not got to saddle yet. He stood at the door,
with his wife and Maurice, greeting all new-comers, and
hoping constantly that there were laggards to come in. He
reached up a hand to grasp the Squire&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;The muster&#8217;s small, old friend,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what else?&#8221; growled Roger. &#8220;We know our Lancashire&mdash;oh,
by the Heart, we know it through and through.&#8221;
He glanced round the courtyard, with the free, wind-trained
eye that saw each face, each detail. &#8220;There&#8217;s few like to
make a hard bed for themselves, Jasper. Best leave our
feather-bed folk at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, with a twinge of pain to which long use had accustomed
him, thought of Rupert, his heir. He glanced aside
from the trouble, and for the first time saw that Nance was
close behind her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Nance go with us?&#8221; he asked, with a quick smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
&#8220;She can ride as well as the best of us&mdash;we know as much,
but women are not soldiers these days, Roger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Squire Demaine looked round for a face he did not find.
&#8220;No, she stays here at Windyhough. Where&#8217;s Rupert? I
always trusted that quiet lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone up to the moors, sir, I think,&#8221; said Maurice,
with some impulse to defend the absent brother. &#8220;He was
full of nightmares just before dawn&mdash;talking of the Prince,
who needed him&mdash;and he was gone when I got up at daybreak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;ll return,&#8221; snapped the Squire; &#8220;and, though I
say it, he&#8217;ll find a bonnie nestling here at Windyhough.
Nance, tell the lad that I trust him. And now, Jasper, we&#8217;ll
be late for the meet on the Langton Road, unless we bestir
ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, under all his unswerving zeal, grew weak with
a fine human tenderness. He turned, caught his wife&#8217;s glance,
wondered in some odd, dizzy way why he had chosen to tear
his heart out by the roots. And Rupert was not here; he had
longed to say good-bye to him, and he was hiding somewhere,
full of shame that was too heavy for his years&mdash;oh, yes, he
knew the lad!</p>

<p>He passed a hand across his eyes, stooped for a moment and
whispered some farewell message to his wife, then set his foot
into the stirrup that Giles was holding for him. His face
cleared. He had chosen the way of action&mdash;and the road lay
straight ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re ready, gentlemen, I take it?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Good!
The Prince might chance to be a little earlier at the meet.
We&#8217;d best be starting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance had slipped from the saddle, and stood, with the
bridle in her hand, watching the riders get into some semblance
of a well-drilled company of horse. At another time
her quick eye would have seen the humour of it. Small farmers&mdash;and
their hinds, on plough-horses&mdash;were jostling thoroughbreds.
Rough faces that she knew were self-conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of a new dignity; rough lips were muttering broad, lively oaths
as if still they were engaged in persuading their mounts to
drive a straight furrow.</p>

<p>Yet to Nance the dignity, the courage, the overwhelming
pity of it all were paramount. The rain and the ceaseless
wind in the courtyard here&mdash;the wintry moors above, with sleet
half covering their black austerity&mdash;the uneasy whinnying of
horses that did not like this cold snap of wind, telling of
snow to come&mdash;all made up the burden of a song that was old
as Stuart haplessness and chivalry.</p>

<p>The muttered oaths, the restlessness, died down. The drill
of months had found its answer now. Rough farmers, keen-faced
yeomen, squires gently-bred, were an ordered company.
They were equals here, met on a grave business that touched
their hearts. And Nance gained courage, while she watched
the men look quietly about them, as if they might not see the
Lancashire moors again, and were anxious to carry a clear
picture of the homeland into the unknown. It seemed that
loyalty so grim, and so unquestioning, was bound to have its
way.</p>

<p>She saw, too, that Sir Jasper was resolute, with a cheeriness
that admitted no denial, saw that her father carried the same
easy air. Then, with a brisk air of command, Sir Jasper gathered
up his reins and lifted his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the King, gentlemen!&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is time we sought
the Langton Road.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was so they rode out, through a soaking rain and a wind
that nipped to the bone; and Nance, because she was young
and untried as yet, felt again the chill of bitter disappointment.
Like Rupert, her childish dreams had been made up
of this Loyal Meet that was to happen one day. Year by
year it had been postponed. Year by year she had heard her
elders talk of it, when listeners were not about, until it had
grown to the likeness of a fairy-tale, in which all the knights
were brave and blameless, all the dragons evil and beyond
reach of pity for the certain end awaiting them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>And now the tale was coming true, so far as the riding out
went. The hunt was up; but there was no flashing of swords
against the clear sunlight she had pictured, no ringing cheers,
no sudden music of the pipes. These knights of the fairy-tale
had proved usual men&mdash;men with their sins and doubts and
personal infirmities, who went on the Prince&#8217;s business as if
they rode to kirk in time of Lent. She was too young to understand
that the faith behind this rainy enterprise sang swifter
and more clear than any music of the pipes.</p>

<p>She heard them clatter down the road. She was soaked to
the skin, and her mare was fidgeting on the bridle which she
still held over-tight, forgetting that she grasped it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will come indoors, Nance?&#8221; said Lady Royd, shivering
at the door. &#8220;They&#8217;ve gone, and we are left&mdash;and that&#8217;s
the woman&#8217;s story always. Men do not care for us, except
as playthings when they see no chance of shedding blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance came out from her dreams. Not the quiet riding-out,
not the rain and the bitter wind, had chilled her as did the
knowledge that Will Underwood was absent from the meet.
She had hoped, without confessing it, that young Hunter&#8217;s
gibe of yesterday would be disproved, that Will would be
there, whatever business had taken him abroad, in time to join
his fellows. He was not there; and, in the hand that was
free of her mare&#8217;s bridle, she crushed the kerchief she had
had in readiness. He had asked for it, to wear when he rode
out&mdash;and he had not claimed it&mdash;and her pride grew resolute
and hot, as if one of her father&#8217;s hinds had laughed at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wet and shivering, child,&#8221; said Lady Royd, her
temper frayed, as always, when men were stupid in their need
to get away from feather-beds. &#8220;I tell you, men are all
alike&mdash;they follow any will-o&#8217;-the-wisp, and name him Faith.
Faith? What has it done for you or me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance quivered, as her mare did, here in the soaking rain
and the wind that would not be quiet. Yet she was resolute,
obedient to her training. &#8220;Faith?&#8221; she said, with an odd
directness and simplicity. &#8220;It will have to help us through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the waiting-time. What else? We are only women here,
and men too old for battle&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget Rupert,&#8221; broke in the other, with the tired
disdain that Nance hated. The girl did not know how Lady
Royd was suffering, how heart and strength and sense of well-being
had gone out with the husband who was all in all to her.
&#8220;Rupert&mdash;the heir&mdash;is here to guard us, Nance. The wind
will rave about the house&mdash;dear heart! how it will rave, and
cry, and whistle&mdash;but Rupert will be here! He&#8217;ll quiet our
fears for us. He is&mdash;so resolute, shall we say?&mdash;so stay-at-home.
Cannot you see the days to come?&#8221; she went on, seeking
a weak relief from pain in wounding others. &#8220;Rupert
will come down to us o&#8217; nights, when the corridors are
draughty with their ghosts, and will tell us he&#8217;s been reading
books&mdash;that we need fear no assault, surprisal, because good
King Charles died for the true faith.&#8221; She drew her wrap
about her and shivered.</p>

<p>She was so dainty, so young of face, that her spite against
the first-born gathered strength by contrast. And, somehow,
warmth returned to Nance, though she was forlorn enough,
and wet to the skin. &#8220;So he did,&#8221; she answered quickly.
&#8220;No light talk can alter that. The King died&mdash;when he
might have bought his life. He <i>disdained</i> to save himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd laughed gently. &#8220;Oh, come indoors, my girl.
You&#8217;ll find Rupert there&mdash;and you can put your heads together,
studying old books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old books? Surely we&#8217;ve seen a new page turned to-day?
These men who gathered to the Loyal Meet&mdash;were they
fools, or bookish? Did they show like men who were riding
out for pastime?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said Lady Royd, with a tired laugh, &#8220;the Stuart
faith becomes you. I see what Sir Jasper meant, when he said
one day that you were beautiful, and I would have it that
you had only the prettiness of youth. Rupert&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance stood at bay, her head up. She did not know her
heart, or the reason of this quiet, courageous fury that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
settled on her. &#8220;Rupert fought on the moor&mdash;for my sake;
you saw the plight Maurice came home in. I tell you, Rupert
can fight like other men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;for books, and causes dead before our time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Cause lives, Lady Royd&mdash;to Rupert and myself,&#8221;
broke in Nance impulsively.</p>

<p>So then the elder woman glanced at her with a new, mocking
interest. &#8220;So the wind sits there, child, does it? It is
&#8216;Rupert and I&#8217; to-day&mdash;and to-morrow it will be &#8216;we&#8217;&mdash;and
what will Mr. Underwood think of the pretty foolery, I
wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl flushed. This tongue of Lady Royd&#8217;s&mdash;it was so
silken, and yet it bit like an unfriendly wind. &#8220;Mr. Underwood&#8217;s
opinion carries little weight these days,&#8221; she said, gathering
her pride together. &#8220;He is known already as the man
who shirked his first big fence and ran away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then, you&#8217;re like the rest of them! All&#8217;s hunting here,
it seems&mdash;you cannot speak without some stupid talk of fox,
or hounds, or fences. For my part, I like Will Underwood.
He&#8217;s smooth and easy, and a respite from the weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He is that,&#8221; assented Nance, with something of the
other&#8217;s irony.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a rest, somehow, from all the wind and rain and
downrightness of Lancashire. But, there! We shall not agree,
Nance. You&#8217;re too like your father and Sir Jasper. Come
indoors, and get those wet clothes off. We shall take a chill,
the two of us, if we stand here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance shivered, more from heart-chill than from cold of
body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;if only some one will take this mare of
mine to stable. She&#8217;s wet and lonely. All her friends have
left her&mdash;to seek the Langton Road.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the older woman was aware of a breadth of sympathy,
an instinctive care for their dumb fellows, that marked
so many of these hill-folk. It seemed barbarous to her that at
a time like this, when women&#8217;s hearts were breaking for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
men, Nance should be thinking of her mare&#8217;s comfort and
peace of mind.</p>

<p>A step sounded across the courtyard. Both women glanced
up sharply, and saw Giles, the bailiff, a ludicrous anger and
worry in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Giles?&#8221; asked his mistress, with soft impatience.
&#8220;Are you a shirker, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my lady. I was not reared that way. Some cursed
fool&mdash;asking pardon for my plain speech&mdash;has stolen my
horse. I&#8217;ll just have to o&#8217;ertake them on foot, I reckon&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His glance rested on Nance&#8217;s mare, big and strong enough
to carry him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Giles, we keep no horse-thieves at Windyhough,&#8221;
said Lady Royd, in her gentle, purring voice. &#8220;Where did
you leave him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tethered to the stable-door, my lady. He couldn&#8217;t have
unslipped the bridle without human hands to help him. It
was this way. I had to see Sir Jasper mounted, and Maister
Maurice. They&#8217;re raither feckless-like, unless they&#8217;ve got
Giles nigh handy to see that all goes well. Well, after they
were up i&#8217; saddle, I tried to get through the swarm o&#8217; folk i&#8217;
the courtyard, and a man on foot has little chance. So I bided
till they gat away, thinking I&#8217;d catch them up; and when
they&#8217;d ridden a lile way down the road, I ran to th&#8217; stable.
Th&#8217; stable-door was there all right, and th&#8217; ring for tething,
but blamed if my fiddle-headed horse warn&#8217;t missing. It was
that way, my lady, take it or leave it&mdash;and maister will be sadly
needing me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was business-like in all emergencies, and his glance wandered
again, as if by chance, from Nance&#8217;s face to the mare&#8217;s
bridle that she held.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a horse in Lancashire just the equal of my
chestnut,&#8221; he said dispassionately; &#8220;but I&#8217;d put up with another,
if &#8217;twere offered me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance, bred on the soil, knew what this sturdy, six-foot fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
asked of her. It was hard to give up the one solace she
had brought to Windyhough&mdash;her mare, who would take her
long scampers up the pastures and the moor when she needed
room about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;She could not carry you, Giles,&#8221; said the girl, answering
the plain meaning behind his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, blithely, miss. But, then, you wouldn&#8217;t spare her,
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence. Nance was asked to give up
something for the Cause&mdash;something as dear to her as hedgerows,
and waving sterns of hounds, and a game fox ahead.
Then she put the bridle into Giles&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;On second thoughts&#8221;&mdash;she halted to stroke the mare&#8217;s
neck&mdash;&#8220;I think, Giles, she&#8217;ll carry you. Tell Sir Jasper that
the women, too, are leal, though they&#8217;re compelled to stay at
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Giles wasted little time in thanks. Business-like, even in
this matter of running his neck into a halter, he sprang to the
mare&#8217;s back. He would be sore before the day was out, because
the saddle was wringing wet by this time; but he was
used to casual hardships.</p>

<p>Lady Royd watched the bailiff ride quickly down the road,
heard the last hoof-beats die away. &#8220;You are odd, you folk
up here,&#8221; she said, with a warmer note in her tired voice.
&#8220;You did not give up your mare lightly, Nance&mdash;and to Giles,
of all men. Who stole his horse, think you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance answered without knowing she had framed the
thought. &#8220;Rupert is missing, too,&#8221; she said, with an odd,
wayward smile. &#8220;I told you he had pluck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet, after they had gone indoors, after she had changed her
riding-gear, Nance sat in the guest-chamber upstairs, and
could think only of Will Underwood. Her dreams of him had
been so pleasant, so loyal; she was not prepared to trample on
them. She saw him giving her a lead on many a bygone hunting-day&mdash;saw
the eager face, and heard his low, persuasive
voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Nance was steadfast, even to disproven trust. She caught
hold of Sir Jasper&#8217;s challenge yesterday, when men had
doubted Will. He would join them on the southward march.
Surely he would, knowing how well she liked him. And the
kerchief he had asked for&mdash;it must wait, until he came in his
own time to claim it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE PRINCE COMES SOUTH</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Rupert</span> stood in the little wood that bordered the Langton
road, waiting for Sir Jasper&#8217;s company of horse to pass. It
would have been chilling work for hardier folk. The rain
soaked him to the skin; the wind stabbed from behind, as the
sly northeaster does. He had no prospect of joining his
friends as yet; his one hope was to follow them, like a culprit
fearing detection, until they and he had ridden so far from
Windyhough that they could not turn him back to eat his heart
out among the women.</p>

<p>Yet he was aglow with a sense of adventure. He was looking
ahead, for the first time in his life, to the open road that
he could share at last with braver men. The horse he had
borrowed from Giles was tugging at the bridle. He checked
it sharply, with a firmness that surprised the pair of them. He
was conscious of a curious gaiety and strength.</p>

<p>Far down the road at last he heard the clink of hoofs, then a
sharp word of command, and afterwards the gaining tumult
of horsemen trotting over sloppy ground. His horse began to
whinny, to strain at the bridle, wondering what the lad was
at. He quieted him as best he could, and the Loyal Meet that
swept past below him had neither thought nor hearing for the
uproar in the wood above.</p>

<p>Rupert saw his father and Squire Demaine riding with set
faces at the head of their motley gathering. Then, after all
had passed and the road seemed clear, there came again the
beat of hoofs from the far distance&mdash;the hoofs of one horse
only, drumming feverishly along the road. And soon Giles,
the bailiff, passed him at a sweltering gallop; and Rupert saw
that he was riding Nance&#8217;s mare.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>The scholar laughed suddenly. Intent on his own business,
he had not guessed until now that Giles would be troubled
when he found his fiddle-headed horse stolen. He could picture
the bailiff&#8217;s face, could hear his broad and Doric speech,
when he found himself without a mount. It was astonishing
to Rupert that he could laugh at such a time, for he was young
to the open road, and had yet to learn what a solace laughter
is to hard-bitten men who fear to take big happenings over-seriously.</p>

<p>He heard Giles gallop out of earshot. Then he led his horse
through the wood and down into the high-road. There was no
onlooker to smile at his clumsy horsemanship, and for that
reason he mounted lightly and handled the reins with easy
firmness; and his horse, doubtful until now, found confidence
in this new rider.</p>

<p>The sun was well up, but it had no warmth. Its watery
light served only to make plainer the cold, sleety hills, the
drab-coloured slush of the trampled highway. Only a fool,
surely&mdash;a fool with some instinct for the forlorn hope&mdash;could
have woven romance about this scene of desolation. Yet
Rupert&#8217;s courage was high, his horse was going blithely under
him. He was picturing the crowd of wiser men whom he had
watched ride by&mdash;the gentry, the thick-thewed yeomen whose
faces were known to him from childhood, the jolly farmers
who had taken their fences on more cheery hunting days than
this. Something stirred at the lad&#8217;s heart as he galloped in
pursuit&mdash;some reaching back to the olden days, some sense of
forward, eager hope. So had the men of Craven, just over
the Yorkshire border, ridden up to Flodden generations since&mdash;ridden
from the plough and hunting-field to a battle that
gave them once for all their place in song and story.</p>

<p>And he, the Scholar, was part, it seemed, of this later riding
out that promised to bring new fame to Lancashire. All was
confused to him as he urged Giles&#8217;s fiddle-headed nag to fresh
endeavour. Old tales of warfare, passed on from mouth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
mouth along the generations, were mingled with this modern
battle that was in the making London way; voices from the
elder days stole down and whispered to him from the windy,
driven moors that had been his playmates. As if some miracle
had waited for him at the cross-ways of the Rising, where
many had chosen the road of doubt and some few the track
of faith, Rupert knew himself the heir at last&mdash;the heir his
father had needed all these years.</p>

<p>His seat in the saddle was one that any knowledgable horseman
might praise. The bailiff&#8217;s chestnut was galloping with
a speed that had taken fire from the rider&#8217;s need to catch up
the Loyal Meet. Rupert was so sure of himself, so sanguine.
He had let his friends ride forward without him because he
had not known how to tell them that at heart he was no fool;
and now, when he overtook them, they would understand at
last.</p>

<p>They pounded over a straight, level stretch of road just
between Conie Cliff Wood and the little farm at the top of
Water Ghyll, and Rupert saw Bailiff Giles half a mile in front
of him. Giles was doing his best to ruin Nance&#8217;s mare for life
in his effort to catch up the hunt; and so Rupert, in the man&#8217;s
way, must needs ask more of his own horse, too, than need demanded.
He would catch up with the bailiff, he told himself,
would race past him, would turn in saddle with a careless
shout that Giles would be late for the Meet unless he stirred
himself. His mood was the more boyish because until he
fought with his brother on the moors a while since he had not
tasted real freedom.</p>

<p>It was not his fault, nor his horse&#8217;s, that they came heedlessly
to a corner of the road where it dipped down a greasy,
curving slope. In the minds of both there was the need for
haste, and they were riding straight, the two of them. His
fiddle-headed beast slipped at the turning of the corner, reeled
half across the road in his effort to recover, and threw his
rider. When Rupert next awoke to knowledge of what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
going forward he found himself alone. Far down the road
he could hear the rattle of his horse as it galloped madly
after its brethren that carried Sir Jasper&#8217;s company.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, meanwhile, had got to Langton High Street, had
drawn his men up on either side of the road. Their horses
were muddied to the girths. The riders were wet to the skin,
splashed and unheroic. Yet from the crowd that had gathered
from the rookeries and the by-streets of the town&mdash;a
crowd not any way disposed to reverence the call of a Stuart
to his loyal friends&mdash;a murmur of applause went up. They
had looked for dainty gentlemen, playing at heroics while the
poor ground at the mill named &#8220;daily bread.&#8221; They saw instead
a company of horse whose members were not insolent,
or gay, or free from weariness. They saw working farmers,
known to them by sight, who were not accounted fools on
market-days. Some glimmering of intelligence came to these
townsfolk who led bitter lives among the by-streets. There
must be &#8220;some queer mak&#8217; o&#8217; sense about it,&#8221; they grumbled
one to another, as they saw that the Loyal Meet was wet to the
skin, and grave and resolute. It was the like resolution&mdash;dumb,
and without help from loyalty to a high Cause&mdash;that
had kept many of them faithful to their wives, their children,
their houses in the back alleys of Langton Town.</p>

<p>The rain ceased for a while, and the sun came struggling
through a press of clouds. And up through the middle of the
street, between the two lines of horsemen and the chattering
crowd behind, a single figure walked. He was big in length
and beam, and he moved as if he owned the lives of men; and
the shrill wind blew his cassock round him.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper moved his horse into the middle of the street,
stooped, and grasped the vicar&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re well met, I think,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What&#8217;s your errand,
Vicar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, just to ring the church bells. My ringer is a George&#8217;s
man&mdash;so&#8217;s my sexton; and I said to both of them, in a plain
parson&#8217;s way, that I&#8217;d need shriving if Langton, one way or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
t&#8217;other, didn&#8217;t ring a Stuart through the town. I can handle
one bell, if not the whole team of six.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper laughed. So did his friends. So did the rabble
looking on.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s well we&#8217;re here to guard you,&#8221; said Sir Jasper,
glancing at the crowd, whose aspect did not promise well for
church bells and such temperate plain-song.</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave, no,&#8221; the Vicar answered with a jolly laugh.
&#8220;I know these folk o&#8217; Langton. They should know me, too,
by now, seeing how often I&#8217;ve whipped &#8217;em from the pulpit&mdash;and
at other times&mdash;yes, at other times, maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Vicar, grey with endeavour and constancy to his trust,
was vastly like Rupert, riding hard in quest of a boy&#8217;s first
adventure. He stood to his full height, and nodded right and
left to the townsmen who were pressing already between the
flanks of Stuart horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men o&#8217; Langton,&#8221; he said, his voice deep, cheery, resonant,
&#8220;Sir Jasper says I need horsemen to guard me in my own
town. Give him your answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The loyal horse, indeed, were anxious for the Vicar&#8217;s safety,
seeing this rabble swarm into the middle of the High Street,
through the double line of riders that had kept them back
till now. They were riding forward already, but the parson
waved them back.</p>

<p>The Vicar stood now in the thick of a roaring crowd that
had him at its mercy. Sir Jasper, who loved a leal man,
tried to get his horse a little nearer, but could not without
riding down defenceless folk; and, while he and his friends
were in grave anxiety and doubt, a sudden hum of laughter
came from the jostling crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoulder him, lads!&#8221; cried one burly fellow.</p>

<p>Five other stalwarts took up the cry, and the Vicar, protesting
with great cheeriness, was lifted shoulder high. And
gradually it grew clear to the Loyal Meet that the parson, as
he had boasted, was safe&mdash;nay, was beloved&mdash;among these
working-folk of Langton.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>They moved up the street, followed by the rabble, and the
two lines of the Loyal Meet were facing each other once more
across the emptying roadway. And by and by, from the old
church on the hill, a furious peal rang out. The Vicar, who
was a keen horseman himself, had named his bells &#8220;a team
of six&#8221;; and never in its history, perhaps, had the team been
driven with such recklessness. The parson held one rope&mdash;one
rein, as he preferred to call it&mdash;and knew how to handle
it. But his five allies had only goodwill to prompt them in
their attempt to ring a peal.</p>

<p>There was noise enough, to be sure; and across the uproar
another music sounded&mdash;music less full-bodied, but piercing,
urgent, not to be denied.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper lifted his head, as a good hound does when he
hears the horn. &#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the pipes, the blessed
pipes! D&#8217;ye hear them? The Prince is near.&#8221;</p>

<p>They scarcely heard the jangling bells. Keen, swift, triumphant,
the sweetest music in the world came louder and
louder round the bend of Langton Street. The riders could
not sit still in saddle, but were drumming lightly with their
feet, as if their stirrups were a dancing-floor. Their horses
fidgeted and neighed.</p>

<p>And then Prince Charles Edward came into Langton, and
these gentry of the Loyal Meet forgot how desolate and cold
the dawn had been. Some of them had waited thirty years
for this one moment; others, the youngsters and the middle-aged,
had been reared on legends of that unhappy &#8217;15 Rising
which had not chilled the faith of Lancashire. And all seemed
worth while now, here in the sunlit street, that was wet and
glistening with the late persistent rain.</p>

<p>The Prince rode alone, his officers a few yards in the rear,
and behind them the strange army, made up of Scottish gentry,
of Highlanders in kilts, of plain Lowland farmers armed with
rusty swords, with scythe-blades fixed on six-foot poles, with
any weapon that good luck had given to their hands.</p>

<p>It was not this motley crew that Sir Jasper saw, nor any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
his company. It was not Lord Murray, a commanding figure
at another time; not Lochiel, lean and debonair and princely,
though both rode close behind the Prince.</p>

<p>The Prince himself drew all men&#8217;s eyes. His clothes, his
Highland bonnet, had suffered from the muddy wet; the bright
hair, that had pleased ladies up in Edinburgh not long ago
when he danced at Holyrood, was clotted by the rain. He
stood plainly on his record as a man, without any of the
fripperies to which women give importance.</p>

<p>And the record was graven on his tired, eager face. Forced
marches had told on him. His sleepless care for the least
among his followers had told on him. He knew that Marshal
Wade was hurrying from Northumberland to overtake him,
that he was riding through a country worse than hostile&mdash;a
country indifferent for the most part, whose men were reckoning
up the chances either way, and choosing as prudence,
not the heart, dictated. Yet behind him was some unswerving
purpose; and, because he had no doubt of his own faith,
he seemed to bring a light from the farther hills into this
muddy street of Langton.</p>

<p>He drew rein, and those behind him pulled up sharply.
The pipes ceased playing, and it seemed as if a healthy, nipping
wind had ceased to blow from these sleet-topped hills of
Lancashire. The Loyal Meet rose in their stirrups, and their
uproar drowned the Vicar&#8217;s bells. They were men applauding
a stronger man, and the pipes themselves could find no
better music.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper rode forward with bared head, and the Prince,
doffing his bonnet in return, reached out a capable, firm hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leal and punctual, sir. I give you greeting,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And the tears, do as he would, were in Sir Jasper&#8217;s eyes.
This man with the fair, disordered hair and the face that
laughed its weariness away, was kingly, resolute, instinct with
the larger air that comes of long apprenticeship to royalty. He
and the Loyal Meet and all the ragged army might be on
their way to execution before the week was out; but the Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
was following this day&#8217;s business without fear of the morrow,
as creed and training taught him.</p>

<p>&#8220;All Langton gives your Highness greeting,&#8221; answered Sir
Jasper, faltering a little because his feelings were so stirred.
&#8220;Our bells are ringing you into your kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince glanced keenly at him, at the faces of the
Loyal Meet. He was quick of intuition, and saw, for the first
time since crossing the Border, that light of zeal, of courage to
the death, which he had hoped to find in England.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re something wet and hungry,&#8221; he said, with the quiet
laugh that had less mirth than sadness in it. &#8220;You hearten
us, I think. My father, as I was setting sail, bade me remember
that Lancashire was always the county of fair women
and clean faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Murray was tired and wet, like the rest of the army;
and, to add to his evil plight, he was consumed by the jealousy
and self-importance that were his besetting luxuries. &#8220;The
church bells, your Highness,&#8221; he said, glancing up the street&mdash;&#8220;I
trust it&#8217;s no ill omen that they ring so desperately out of
tune.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper saw the Prince move impatiently in saddle, saw
him struggle with some irritation that was not of yesterday.
And he felt, rather than framed the clear thought, that there
were hot-and-cold folk among the Scots, as here in Lancashire.</p>

<p>Then the Prince&#8217;s face cleared. &#8220;My lord Murray,&#8221; he said
suavely, &#8220;all bells ring in tune when loyal hands are at the
ropes. Your ear, I think, is not trained to harmony. And
now, gentlemen, what food is in your town? Enough to give
a mouthful to us all? Good! We can spare an hour in
Langton, and after that we must be jogging forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hour was one of surprise to Sir Jasper and his friends.
Here was an army strong enough to raid the town, to break
into the taverns, to commit licence and excess; yet there was
no licence, nor thought of it. A Stuart, his fair hair muddied
and unkempt, had charge of this march south; and his will
was paramount, because his army loved him. No fear, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
usual soldier&#8217;s obedience to discipline, could have hindered
these Scots from rapine when they found the town&#8217;s resources
scanty for their hunger; but the fearlessness, the comradeship
of their leader had put honour, sharp as a sword, between temptation
and themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must foot our bill here, Sir Jasper,&#8221; said the Prince
as they were preparing to ride out again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that can wait&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, by your leave! Theft is the trade of men who steal
thrones. I will not have it said that any town in England
was poorer because a Stuart came that way. Lochiel, you
carry our royal purse,&#8221; he broke off, with a quick, impulsive
laugh. &#8220;Peep into it and see how much is left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough to pay our score, your Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;re rich, Lochiel! We may be poor to-morrow,
but to-day we&#8217;re rich enough to pay our debts.&#8221;</p>

<p>A half-hour later they rode out into the wintry, ill-found
roads, into the open country, wet and desolate, that was
guarded by sleet-covered uplands. And Sir Jasper, who had
the countryman&#8217;s superstitious outlook on the weather, remembered
Lord Murray, his cold, easy smile, as he said that
the Langton bells were ringing out of tune.</p>

<p>A mile south from Langton, as Giles, the bailiff at Windyhough,
was riding not far behind the gentry&mdash;having at heart
the need to keep his master well in sight&mdash;a fiddle-headed horse
came blundering down the road. The beast was creamed with
foam, and he scattered the footmen right and left as he made
forward. Only when he reached Giles&#8217;s side he halted, stood
shivering with the recoil from his own wild gallop, and pushed
his nose up against the bailiff&#8217;s bridle-hand. And Giles, with
scant respect for the mare that had carried him so far, slipped
from the saddle, and fussed about the truant as if he were a
prodigal returned. Giles did not heed that he was holding up
all the men behind, that the gentlemen in front had drawn
rein, aware of some disturbance in the rear, and that the Prince
himself was asking what the trouble was.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>&#8220;Where hast thou been, old lad? I thought thee lost,&#8221; the bailiff
was muttering, with all a countryman&#8217;s disregard of bigger
issues when his heart was touched. And the horse could not
tell him that, after throwing Rupert, he had lost sight of
the master he pursued and had wasted time in seeking him
down casual by-roads. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ve had an ill rider, by the look o&#8217;
thee. Ye threw him, likely? Well, serve him right&mdash;serve
him varry right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Giles, with a slowness that suggested he had all the time in
the world to spare, got to the back of the fiddle-headed chestnut,
and felt at home again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What mun I do wi&#8217; this lile nag?&#8221; he asked dispassionately,
still holding the reins of Nance&#8217;s borrowed mare.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, seeing that his bailiff was the cause of this unexpected
check, could not keep back his laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the pleasantry?&#8221; asked the Prince. &#8220;Tell it to me.
I think we need a jest or two, if we&#8217;re to get safely over these
evil roads of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is naught, your Highness&mdash;naught at all, unless you
know Giles as I do. He thinks more of that fiddle-headed
horse of his than of the pick amongst our Lancashire hunters&mdash;and
he&#8217;s holding up our whole advance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What mun I do wi&#8217; the mare?&#8221; repeated Giles, looking
round him with a large impassiveness. &#8220;I can&#8217;t take a led
mare to Lunnon and do my share o&#8217; fighting by the way. It
stands to reason I mun have one hand free.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince, whose instinct for the humour of the road had
put heart into his army since the forced march began, looked
quietly for a moment at Giles&#8217;s face. Its simplicity, masking
a courage hard as bog-oak, appealed to him. &#8220;By your
leave, Sir Jasper,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my horse will scarcely last the
day out&mdash;these roads have punished him. I shall be glad of
the mare, if you will lend her to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the march was moving forward again, the Prince in
the grey mare&#8217;s saddle, Lord Murray turned to an intimate
who rode beside him. &#8220;His Highness forgets old saws,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
murmured, with the insolent assurance that attaches to the
narrow-minded. &#8220;&#8216;Never change horses when crossing a
stream&#8217;&mdash;surely all prudent Scotsmen know the superstition.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Sir Jasper, riding close beside the Prince, did not hear
him. His heart, in its own way, was simple as Giles&#8217;s, and he
was full of pride. &#8220;I wish my god-daughter could know,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your god-daughter?&#8221; echoed the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;Nance Demaine. It is her mare you&#8217;ve borrowed,
sir&mdash;and I should know, seeing I gave it her&mdash;though for the
life of me I can&#8217;t guess how she chanced to join the Rising.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince smiled as his glance met Sir Jasper&#8217;s. &#8220;There&#8217;s
no chance about this Rising,&#8221; he said pleasantly, as if he
talked of the weather or the crops. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to the
Throne, my friend, or to the death; but, either way, there&#8217;s no
chance about it&mdash;and no regrets, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper felt again that sharp, insistent pity which had
come to him at sight of the yellow-haired laddie who had left
women&#8217;s hearts aching up across the border. In this wild
campaign it seemed that he had met a friend. And he spoke,
as comrades do, disdaining ceremony.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the faith I hold,&#8221; he said, with an odd gentleness
that seemed to have the strength of the moors behind it.
&#8220;Comrades are few on the road o&#8217; life, your Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince glanced at him, as he had glanced at Giles not
long ago&mdash;shrewdly, with mother-wit and understanding.
&#8220;They&#8217;re few,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;and priceless. I would God, sir,
that you&#8217;d infect my lord Murray with something of your
likeable, warm spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Sir Jasper sighed, as he looked far down the road to
London, and reckoned up the leagues of hardship they must
traverse. Their task was perilous enough for men united in
common zeal; dissension from within, of which he had already
heard more hints than one, was a more dangerous enemy
than Marshal Wade and all his army of pursuit.</p>

<p>Yet Sir Jasper had relief in action, in the need to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
every workaday happening of the march. With his son,
thrown on the Langton Road, and listening to the hoof-beats
of the runaway horse as he went to join the Rising, the case
was otherwise. His one comrade had deserted him. He was
here on the empty road, with failure for his sole companion.
His first impulse was the horse&#8217;s&mdash;to run fast and hard, in
the hope of overtaking his own kind. He ran forward dizzily,
tripped over a stone that some wagoner had used to check his
wheel while he rested his team, got up again, and felt a sharp,
throbbing pain in his right ankle. He tried to plod on, for all
that, his face set London way&mdash;failed, and sat down by the
wet roadside. And the wheels of circumstance passed over
him, numbing his faith in God.</p>

<p>They all but crushed him. He had dreamed of Prince
Charles Edward; had learned at last to sit a horse, because he
needed to follow where high enterprise was in the doing; had
known the luxury of a gallop in pursuit of men who had
thought him short of initiative.</p>

<p>And now he was the Scholar again. His horse had failed
him. His own feet had played him false. He sat there, wet
and homeless, and from the cloudy hills a smooth, contemptuous
voice came whispering at his ear. Best be done with a life
that had served him ill. He was a hindrance to himself, to
his friends. Best creep down to the pool at the road-foot; he
had bathed there often in summer and knew its depth. Best
end it all&mdash;the shame, the laughter of strong men, the constant
misadventure that met him by the way. He was weak
and accursed. None would miss him if he went to sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said deliberately, as if answering an enemy in
human shape, &#8220;a Royd could not do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper&#8217;s view of his first-born was finding confirmation.
The soul of the lad had been tempered to a nicety, and the
bodily pain scarce troubled him, as he set his face away from
London and the Prince, and limped toward home. Now and
then he was forced to rest, because sickness would not let him
see the road ahead; but always he got up again. Self-blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
had grown to be a mischievous habit with him, and he was
ashamed now that he had deserted his allotted post. True, his
father, in bidding him guard Windyhough, had practised a
tender fraud on him; but he had given his word, and had been
false to it when the first haphazard temptation met him by the
way. It had been so easy to steal Giles&#8217;s horse, so easy to
scamper off along the road of glamour, so bitter-hard to stay
among the women.</p>

<p>The lad was over-strained and heart-sick, ready to make
molehills into mountains; yet his shame was bottomed on
sound instinct. He came of a soldier-stock, and in the tissues
of him was interwoven this contempt for the sentry who forsook
his post. No danger threatened Windyhough. He was
returning to a duty which, in itself, was idle; but he had
pledged his word.</p>

<p>He struggled forward. The road to London was not for
him; but at least he could keep faith with the father who
was riding now, no doubt, beside the Prince.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE HEIR RETURNS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Windyhough, Martha the dairymaid was restless, like all
the women left about the house. She could not settle to her
work, though it was churning-day, and good cream was likely
to be wasted. Martha at five-and-thirty, had not found a
mate, yet she would have made a good wife to any man;
strong, supple, with wind and roses in her cheeks, she was born
to matronhood; though, by some blindness that had hindered
the farmer-folk about her when she crossed their path, she
had not found her road in life. And, in her quiet, practical
way, she knew that the shadows were beginning to lengthen
down her road, that she might very well go on dairying, eating,
sleeping, till they buried her in the churchyard of St.
John&#8217;s&mdash;no more, no less.</p>

<p>The prospect had never shown so cheerless as it did just
now. The men, as their habit was, had all the luck; they had
gone off on horseback, pretending that some cause or other
took them into open country. For her part, she was tired of
being left behind.</p>

<p>Lady Royd was indoors. The housekeeper was not about
to keep the maids attentive to routine. All was silent and
lack-lustre; and Martha went down the road till she reached
the gate at its foot&mdash;the gate that stood open after letting the
Loyal Meet ride through.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s queer and lonesome, when all&#8217;s said,&#8221; she thought,
swinging gently on the gate. &#8220;Men are bothersome cattle&mdash;full
o&#8217; tempers and contrariness&mdash;but, dear heart, I miss their
foolishness.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thought the matter out for lack of better occupation,
but came to no conclusion. In front of her, as she sat on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
top bar of the gate, she could see the muddied hoof-tracks that
marked the riding-out. Her own father, her two brothers,
were among Sir Jasper&#8217;s company; they were thrifty, common-sense
folk, like herself, and she wondered if there was
something practical, after all, in this business that had left
Windyhough so empty and so silent.</p>

<p>A man&#8217;s figure came hobbling up the road&mdash;a broad, well-timbered
figure enough, but bent about the legs and shoulders.
It was Simon Foster, coming in tired out from roaming up
and down the pastures. Though scarce turned fifty, he had
been out with the &#8217;15 Rising, thirty years ago; but rheumatism
had rusted his joints before their time, and to-day, because he
was not fit to ride with haler men, he had kept away from the
Meet at Windyhough, for he dared not trust himself to stand
an onlooker at this new Rising.</p>

<p>Martha got down from the gate, and opened it with a mock
curtsey. &#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to see a man, Simon,&#8221; she said, moved
by some wintry coquetry. &#8220;I began to fancy, like, we were
all women here at Windyhough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we are,&#8221; he growled&mdash;&#8220;but I&#8217;d set ye in your places,
that I would, if nobbut I could oil my joints.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve come home in a nice temper, Simon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, lass, and I&#8217;ll keep it, till I know whether Sir Jasper
has set a crown on the right head. It isn&#8217;t easy, biding here
wi&#8217; Lancashire weather&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Lancashire witches,&#8221; put in Martha, with sly provocation.</p>

<p>Simon was tired, and had nothing especial to do; so he
stayed awhile, telling himself that a maid&#8217;s blandishments,
though daft and idle, were one way of passing the time. &#8220;Oh,
ay, you&#8217;re snod enough, Martha,&#8221; he said, rubbing his lean
chin. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen few in my time to better ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Simon! And they say your tongue is rough as an
old file. For my part, I allus knew ye could be kind and
easy, if ye&#8217;d a mind to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I war a bit of a devil once, may be,&#8221; he admitted, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
slow, pleasant laugh, as if he praised himself unduly for past
escapades. &#8220;Ay, a bit of a devil, Martha. I&#8217;ll own to it.
But rheumatiz has taught me sense since them days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sense is as you take it, Simon. Ye might shoot wider o&#8217;
the mark than to peep at a lass&#8217;s een, just whiles, like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simon Foster, feeling that their talk grew warmer than
mere pleasantry demanded, glanced away from the topic. &#8220;I
saw summat on my way down fro&#8217; the moor,&#8221; he said, dry and
matter-of-fact once more. &#8220;There&#8217;s no accounting for it, but
I saw it with my two eyes, and I&#8217;m puzzled. You wouldn&#8217;t
call me less than sober, Martha?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she put in dryly. &#8220;Sobriety was allus a little bit of
a failing wi&#8217; ye, Simon. There&#8217;s times to be sober, I allus
did say&mdash;and times to be playful, as the kitten said to the
tabby-cat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I happened to look into th&#8217; sky, just as I&#8217;d getten
past Timothy Wantless&#8217;s barn, and I saw summat,&#8221; went on
Simon stolidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So ye went star-gazing? Shame on ye! Only lads i&#8217;
their courting time go star-gazing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe. But it was daylight, as it happened, and I wasn&#8217;t
thinking o&#8217; courtship&mdash;not just then,&#8221; he added guardedly.
&#8220;I war thinking of an old mare I meant to sell Timothy Wantless
to-morn for twice as much as she&#8217;s worth. She wasn&#8217;t
fit to carry one o&#8217; Sir Jasper&#8217;s men, and she&#8217;ll ruin him i&#8217;
corn afore he comes back fro&#8217; Lunnon, and it stands to reason
she mun be sold for what she&#8217;ll fetch. And I war scratching
my head, like, wondering how I&#8217;d get round Timothy&mdash;he&#8217;s
stiff and snappy at a bargain&mdash;when I happened to look up&mdash;and
there war men on horseback, fair i&#8217; th&#8217; middle o&#8217; the sky,
riding all as it might have been a hunting day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good sakes! I&#8217;ll go skerry to my bed, Simon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It war queer, I own; and, if they&#8217;d been on safe ground,
I&#8217;d have run in to see what &#8217;twas all about; but, seeing they
were up above, I watched &#8217;em a while, and then I left &#8217;em to
it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>Martha&#8217;s brief mood of superstition passed. &#8220;Simon,
you&#8217;re as sober as a man that&#8217;s never had th&#8217; chance to step into
an ale-house, and you&#8217;re over old to be courting-daft&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so old, my lass,&#8221; he broke in, with the heat she had
tempted from him. &#8220;I should know, at my age, how to court
a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you do, Simon&mdash;if nobbut you&#8217;d try your hand,
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lads go daft about ye women&mdash;think ye&#8217;re all made up
of buttercups and kiss-me-quicks. But I know different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ay?&#8221; asked Martha gently. &#8220;What d&#8217;ye know,
Simon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naught so much, lass&mdash;only that women are like nettles.
Handle &#8217;em tenderly, and they&#8217;ll gi&#8217;e ye a rash ye can feel for
a week o&#8217; days. But grasp &#8217;em&mdash;and they&#8217;re soft as lettuces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I allus did say older men had more sense than lads.
You&#8217;re right, Simon. Grasp us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, another day,&#8221; said Simon&mdash;bluntly, and with a hint of
fear. &#8220;For my part, I&#8217;m too full o&#8217; Sir Jasper&#8217;s business to
heed any sort o&#8217; moonshine.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was half up the road already, but she enticed him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;These men you saw riding in the sky, Simon? You&#8217;ve
frightened me&mdash;and I was allus feared o&#8217; ghosties.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simon, though he would not admit it, was troubled by the
picture he had seen, up yonder on the moors; and, after the
human fashion, he was willing to share his trouble with
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I saw &#8217;em&mdash;no denying that,&#8221; he said, returning
slowly. &#8220;There were two riding at the front&mdash;like as it might
have been Sir Jasper and Squire Demaine&mdash;and a lot o&#8217; horsemen
scampering after. There was thick haze all across the
sky, and I saw &#8217;em like a picture in a printed book. I&#8217;d have
thought less about it, Martha, if it hadn&#8217;t been that Maister
Rupert&mdash;the day, ye mind, he came home from fighting his
brother&mdash;told me how, that varry morn, he&#8217;d seen the like picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
up above his head&mdash;just horsemen, he said, galloping up
and down where honest sky should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ben o&#8217; the stables war talking of it awhile since, now I
call to mind. One here and there had seen the same sort
o&#8217; picture, he said; but I paid no heed. Ben was allus light
and feather-brained&mdash;not steady, Simon, like ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her glance was tender, frank, dismaying; and Simon answered
it with a slow, foolish smile. &#8220;Steady is as steady
does. For my part&mdash;what wi&#8217; rheumatiz, and seeing other
folk get all the fighting, and me left at home&mdash;ye could mak
a bit of a lile fool o&#8217; me, Martha, I do believe. Ye&#8217;re so bonnie,
like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No harm i&#8217; that, is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not just what ye&#8217;d call harm&mdash;not exactly harm&mdash;but
my day&#8217;s over, lass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the rooster said when he war moulting,
Simon; but he lived to crow another day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simon had learned from the far-off days of soldiering that
there are times when the bravest are counselled to retreat in
good order. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m i&#8217; the moult just now,&#8221; he said impassively,
&#8220;and it&#8217;s time I gat into th&#8217; house, now they&#8217;re made
me some queer sort of indoor servant. Lady Royd will be
wanting this and that&mdash;ye know her pretty-prat way, needing
fifty things i&#8217; a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Simon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He trudged steadily forward, not turning his head; and
Martha sighed as she climbed the gate again and began to
rock gently to and fro. &#8220;Men are kittlesome cattle,&#8221; she said
discontentedly.</p>

<p>Round the bend of the road below she heard the sound of
footsteps&mdash;halting steps that now and then ceased for a while.
She forgot Simon, forgot her peevishness, as she saw the
figure that came up the road towards her. All the motherhood
that was strong and eager in this lass came to the front
as she saw Rupert, the heir&mdash;Rupert, who had been missing
since the dawn&mdash;come home in this derelict, queer fashion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
She ran out and put an arm about him. He was not the heir
now, the master left in charge of Windyhough; he was the lad
whose cries she had helped to still, long since in nursery days.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sir, ye&#8217;re i&#8217; th&#8217; wars, and proper. You&#8217;re limping
sorely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert steadied himself against her arm for a moment, then
put her away and went forward. &#8220;Nay, I&#8217;m out of the wars,
Martha,&#8221; he said, with the rare smile that made friends among
those who chanced to see it. &#8220;I&#8217;m out of the wars&mdash;and
that&#8217;s my trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re limping&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he snapped, with sudden loss of temper. &#8220;I&#8217;m limping,
Martha&mdash;since my birth. That&#8217;s no news to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went in at the door of Windyhough, and in the hall
encountered Lady Royd. The light was dim here, and she did
not see his weariness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been, Rupert?&#8221; she asked peevishly.</p>

<p>He kissed her lightly on the cheek. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been up the
moors, mother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;planning how best to defend Windyhough
if the attack should come.&#8221; He was here to take up
the post allotted to him, and to his last ebb of strength he
meant to be debonair and cheery, as his father would have
been under like hardship. &#8220;There are so few men left here,
and all of us are either old, or&mdash;or useless,&#8221; he added, with
his whimsical, quiet smile.</p>

<p>Lady Royd, oppressed by loneliness, swept out of her self-love
by the storm of this Loyal Meet that had left her in its
wake, stood near to the life which is known to workaday folk&mdash;the
life made up of sleet and a little sun, of work and the
need for faith and courage. She looked at her boy, trying to
read his face in the dull, uncertain light; and her heart ached
for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Rupert,&#8221; she said by and by, &#8220;there&#8217;s no fear of attack.
The march has gone south&mdash;the fighting will be there,
not here&mdash;you overheard your father say as much.&#8221;</p>

<p>He winced, remembering the eagerness with which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
followed Sir Jasper round the house, the pride he had felt
in noting each loophole, the muskets, and the piles of shot entrusted
to his care. He recalled, with minute and pitiful
exactness, how afterwards he had been an unwilling listener
while his father said it had been all a fairy-tale to lull his
elder-born to sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father said it was child&#8217;s-play,&#8221; he answered quietly.
&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m not likely to forget just what he said&mdash;and what
he left unsaid. But, mother, the storm might blow this way
again, and I&#8217;m here to guard you, as I promised.&#8221;</p>

<p>The day was no easy one for Rupert, accustomed from childhood
to find himself in the rear of action. Yet it was harder
to Lady Royd, who had known little discipline till now, who
looked at this son who was counted scholarly, and, with eyes
accustomed to the dim light of the hall, saw at last the stubborn
manhood in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not guess,&#8221; she said, her voice gentle, wondering,
submissive&mdash;&#8220;Rupert, I did not guess till now why your
father was always so full of trust in you.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes brightened. He had expected a colder welcome
from this pretty, sharp-tongued mother. It seemed, after all,
he had done well to return to his post at Windyhough. His
thoughts ran forward, like a pack in full cry. The battle
might shift north again&mdash;there might be some hot skirmish in
the open, or the need to protect fugitives at Windyhough&mdash;or
twenty pleasant happenings that would give him escape from
idle sentry-duty here. Rupert was at his dreams again. An
hour since he had dragged himself along the road, sick at
heart, sick of body, disillusioned altogether; and now he was
eager with forward hope because Lady Royd, from the pain
of her own trouble, had found one swift word of encouragement.
Encouragement had been rare in the lad&#8217;s life, and he
found it a fine stimulant&mdash;too fine a one for his present needs.
He moved quickly forward. His damaged foot bent under
him, and for a moment the pain made him wince.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing, mother,&#8221; he said, dropping on to the settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and looking up with the quiet smile that haunted her. &#8220;I&#8217;m
tired and wet&mdash;wet through to the heart, I think&mdash;let me get
up and help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not know what to do with this son, who was growing
dearer to her each moment. Shut off from real life too
long, she had no skill such as workaday mothers would have
learned by now, and she called shrilly for the servants.</p>

<p>A big man, bent in the body, made his way forward presently
through the women, pushing, them aside as if he picked
his way through useless lumber. It was Simon Foster, who
had grown used, in the far-off &#8217;15 Rising, to the handling of
wounded men.</p>

<p>&#8220;A baddish sprain&mdash;no more, no less,&#8221; he growled, after
he had taken off boot and stocking and looked at the swollen
ankle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the poor lad!&#8221; cried Lady Royd, fidgety and useless.
&#8220;Go, one of you, for the surgeon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need, my lady,&#8221; broke in Simon Foster. He
had forgotten the manners of a trained servant, and was back
again in the happy days when he had carried a pike for the
Cause and did not know it lost. &#8220;I&#8217;ve mended worse matters
than this in my time. You, Martha, get bandages.
They&#8217;re somewhere handy&mdash;we brought plenty in at haytime,
along with the powder-kegs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd did not rebuke him. Martha, who not long
since had tempted him to folly, went off submissively to do
his bidding. It seemed natural to these women that a man
should be in command&mdash;a man who knew his mind and did
not turn aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Simon, after he had strapped the ankle. &#8220;It
will bother ye a while, master, but there&#8217;s a lot o&#8217; time for
rest these days at Windyhough. Let me gi&#8217;e ye an arm up the
stair. Ye&#8217;d best get to bed, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance Demaine had kept to her room this morning. They
had brought her to Windyhough, had taken her mare, had left
her derelict in a house that harboured only memories of past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
deeds. The active men were gone; the mettled horses were
gone; she was bidden to keep within four walls, and wait, and
pray. And she wished neither to pray nor to be stifled by
four house-walls; she longed to be out in the open country,
following the open road that had led to her heart&#8217;s desire.
Tired of her own thoughts at last, she went out on to the landing,
with a restless sense that duty was calling her below-stairs;
but she got no farther than the window that looked on
a stormy sweep of moorland.</p>

<p>Nance was in a bitter mood, as she sat in the window-seat
and watched the white, lifeless hills, the sodden fields. Squire
Demaine had trained her to love of galloping and loyalty, had
taught her that England&#8217;s one, prime need was to see a Stuart
on the throne again; and now, when deeds were asked of
men and women both, he had left her here, to weave samplers,
or to help Lady Royd brew simples in the stillroom,
while they waited for their men to come home from the
slaying.</p>

<p>There was Will Underwood, too. With the obstinacy that
attaches to a girl&#8217;s first love, she was warm in defence of him
against the men who had liked him&mdash;some few of them&mdash;but
had never trusted him. He had not come to claim her kerchief.
Well, he would claim it another day; he had his own
reasons, doubtless, for joining the Meet farther south. Some
urgent message had reached him&mdash;from the Prince himself,
may be&mdash;bidding him ride out on an errand of especial danger.
No surmise was too wild to find acceptance. He was
so strong, so graceful and well-favoured; he sat his horse so
well, courted risks which prudent riders declined. It was
fitting that he should be chosen for some post demanding
gaiety, a firm seat in saddle, and reckless courage.</p>

<p>Nance, for all the sleety outlook, was seeing this Rising again
as a warm, impulsive drama. She had watched Sir Jasper
and her father ride out, had been chilled by their simple
gravity; but she had forgotten the lesson already, in her girl&#8217;s
need for the alluring and the picturesque. This love of hers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
for Underwood was an answer to the like need. At all hazards
she must have warmth and colour, to feed her young,
impulsive dreams of a world built in the midst of fairyland.
She could not know, just yet, that the true warmth, the true,
vivid colours come to those who, not concerned with the
fairyland of make-believe, ride leal and trusty through the
wind that stings their faces, over the sloppy, ill-found roads
that spatter them with mud.</p>

<p>She was desolate, this child who sat in the window-seat and
constructed all afresh the picture of her hero-lover. She was
weaving one of the samplers she despised, after all&mdash;not with
wool and canvas, but in fancy&#8217;s loom. Obstinate in her demand
for vivid drama, she was following Will Underwood
already on this errand that the Prince had entrusted to his
care. She saw him riding through the dangerous night roads,
and prayed for his safety, at each corner of a highway peopled
with assassins. She saw him galloping recklessly in open daylight,
meeting odds laughable in their overwhelming number,
killing his men, not singly but by scores, as he rode on, untouched,
and gay, and loyal to his trust. It is so that young
love is apt to make its idol a knight miraculous, moving
through a cloud-land too ethereal for the needs of each day
as it comes. Nance Demaine could hold her own in the open
country; but here, shut in by the walls of a house that was
old and dumb, waiting for the men&#8217;s return, she reached out
for Will Underwood&#8217;s help, and needed him&mdash;or needed the
untried, easy air of romance that he carried with him.</p>

<p>She got up from the window-seat at last. The sleet and
the piping wind wearied her. She was tired already of inaction,
ashamed of the thoughts that could not keep away from
pictures of Will Underwood, riding on the Prince&#8217;s service.
She remembered that she was a guest here, that she must
get away from her dreams as best she might.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go down,&#8221; she said fretfully. &#8220;Lady Royd will be
needing me. And she&#8217;ll take my hands, and cry a little, and
ask me, &#8216;Will Sir Jasper live?&#8217; And then she&#8217;ll kiss me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
cry again, and ask, &#8216;Will Sir Jasper die?&#8217; Oh, I know it all
beforehand! But I must go down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even now she could not bring herself to the effort. She
paced up and down the floor of her bedchamber. Disdain of
her position here, intemperate dislike of weaklings, the longing
to be out and about under the free sky, were overwhelming
in their call to this child who needed discipline. And,
though she was Squire Demaine&#8217;s child, she resented this first,
drab-coloured call of duty.</p>

<p>She braced herself to the effort. But she was bitter still,
and some remembrance of her father&#8217;s teaching took her unawares.
&#8220;Lady Royd comes from the south country, where
they killed a Royal Stuart once,&#8221; she muttered. &#8220;She does
not know&mdash;she cannot even learn&mdash;our northern ways. Sir
Jasper lives or dies&mdash;but either way he lives. She does not
know that either way he <i>lives</i>&mdash;as we count life up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance was shaken by the passion known to women who
have seen their men go out to war&mdash;the passion that finds no
outlet in hard give-and-take&mdash;the desperate, keen heartache
that is left to feed upon itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go down,&#8221; she said, as if repeating a lesson hard to
learn.</p>

<p>As she opened the door and crossed the landing, she heard a
heavy footfall on the stair below, then Simon Foster&#8217;s laboured
breathing. Some instinct of disaster chilled her. In this
house of emptiness, with the wind roaming like an unquiet
ghost down every corridor, she listened to the uncanny, stealthy
upcoming. Once, years ago, she had heard men bringing
home her brother, killed in the hunting-field; and it seemed to
her that she was listening to the same sounds again, was feeling
the same vague, unreasoning dread. Then she remembered
that Rupert had been missing since dawn, and she was
moved by some grief that struck deeper than she understood.</p>

<p>They turned the corner of the stair at last, and Nance saw
Rupert coming up&mdash;Rupert, his face grey and tired as he
leaned on Simon&#8217;s arm; Rupert, who looked older, manlier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
more like Sir Jasper. And then, for no reason she could have
given, she lost half her grief. At least he was not dead; and
there was a look about him which stronger men of her
acquaintance had worn when they were in the thick of trouble.</p>

<p>There was a long, mullioned window lighting the stairway
head. And Rupert, looking up, saw Nance standing there&mdash;close
to him, yet far away as some lady of dreams might
stand. The keen winter&#8217;s sun, getting out from sleet-clouds,
made a St. Luke&#8217;s summer round about her; and Nance, who
was just comely, good to see, at other times, borrowed a
strange beauty from the hour and place, and from the human
pity that was troubling her.</p>

<p>Rupert halted on the landing, and looked at her as if she
were food and drink to him. Then he flushed, and turned his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather have met any one but
you just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why, my dear?&#8221; asked Nance, with simple tenderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Because I&#8217;m maimed, and sick at heart,&#8221; he said
savagely.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did it come about?&#8221; she interrupted, with the same
impulsive tenderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried to join the Rising, and was thrown. So much was
to be expected, Nance?&#8221;</p>

<p>She had been thinking hard things of stay-at-homes and
weaklings; and, as she looked at Rupert now, she was touched
by keen reproach. He was ashamed, tired out, in pain of soul
and body; yet he was smiling, was making a jest of his indifferent
horsemanship.</p>

<p>Nance recalled once more that evening on the moors, when
Rupert had bidden Will Underwood ride with her to Windyhough,
while he stayed with his brother. In his voice, in the
set of his whole face, there had been a stubborn strength that
had astonished her; and here again, on the sunlit, draughty
stairhead, he was showing her a glimpse of his true self.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>&#8220;I wish you better luck,&#8221; she said simply&mdash;&#8220;oh, so much
better luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw that there were tears in her eyes, and felt his weakness
coming on him like a cloud, and fought it for a moment
longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will come, Nance,&#8221; he said&mdash;cheerily, though he felt
himself a liar. &#8220;Go down to mother. She&mdash;she needs help
more than I. Now, Simon, you&#8217;ve got your breath again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, maister&mdash;as mich as I shall ever get, as the short-winded
horse said when they asked him why he roared like
a smithy-bellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go forward&#8221;&mdash;again the keen, bitter smile&mdash;&#8220;to
the lumber-room, Simon, among the broken odds and ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance stood aside, finding no words to help herself or him,
and watched them go along the corridor, and in at the door of
Rupert&#8217;s bedchamber. And she knew, beyond doubt or surmise,
that the Loyal Meet had left one useful volunteer at
home to-day.</p>

<p>She found Lady Royd in the low-raftered parlour that always
carried an air of luxury and ease. In summer it was
heavy with the scent of garden flowers; and now there was a
tired, luxurious appeal from bowls of faded rose-leaves set
everywhere about the room. A fire, too big for the comfort
of open-air folk, was crackling on the hearth. In all things
this parlour was a dainty frame enough for the mistress whose
beauty had been nipped, not strengthened, by the keen winds
of Lancashire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nance, will he live?&#8221; asked Lady Royd, running forward
with the outstretched hands, the very words, that she had
looked for. But she spoke of Rupert, not of Sir Jasper.
&#8220;He came home so wearied-out&mdash;so lame and grey of
face&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I met him on the stairhead just now,&#8221; broke in Nance,
with sharp common sense. &#8220;He&#8217;s had a fall from his horse&mdash;and
he made a jest of it&mdash;and that is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;ll not die, you think? Nance, tell me, he&#8217;ll not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
die. I&#8217;ve been unkind to him in days past, and I&mdash;I am
sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to Nance that in this house of Windyhough she
was never to escape from pity, from the sharper, clearer insight
into life that these hopeless days were teaching her.
This pretty matron, whom her husband had spoiled, sheltering
her from draughts as if she were a hothouse flower too rare
to take her chance in the open border&mdash;she was foolish as of
old, so far as speech and manner went. But in her face, in
her lisping, childish voice, there was a new, strong appeal that
touched the younger woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that he&mdash;will <i>live</i>,&#8221; said the girl, with sudden passion.
&#8220;He&#8217;s here among the women now&mdash;but to-morrow&mdash;or
the next day, or the next&mdash;he&#8217;ll prove himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd moved aimlessly about the room, warmed her
hands at the fire, shivered as she glanced at the wintry sunlight
out of doors. Then she came close to Nance, as if asking
protection of some kind. &#8220;You hold the Faith, child. I
do not,&#8221; she said, with bewildering candour.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Lady Royd&mdash;indeed, we&#8217;re of the same Faith&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, in the open shows, when folk are looking on. I&#8217;d as
lief go abroad without my gown as not be seen at Mass. It
is asked of Sir Jasper&#8217;s wife; so is constancy to the yellow-haired
laddie who has sent sober men astray. Veiled lids are
asked for when Will Underwood makes pretty speeches, with
his eyes on fire; but at my heart, child&mdash;at my heart I&#8217;ve faith
only in each day&#8217;s ease as it comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Underwood has gone to the wars,&#8221; broke in Nance,
with an odd sense of misery and an obstinate contempt, for
all that, of this woman&#8217;s prattling. &#8220;He&#8217;ll come back in
his own time, Lady Royd, after the King is on his throne
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>has</i> he gone to the wars? I missed him among our
friends to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he has ridden on a private errand of the Prince&#8217;s.&#8221;
Nance was reckless in her protection of Will&#8217;s honour. &#8220;He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was the likeliest rider of them all to be chosen for such
service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there! And I hoped he would be wise, and stay at
home, and ride over now and then to cheer us with his pleasant
face.&#8221; Her smile was frail and listless, with a certain youthful
archness in it that drew men to her side; but its appeal was
lost on Nance. &#8220;Of course, I am loyal to Sir Jasper&mdash;and I
shall cry each night till he returns&mdash;but Will&#8217;s homage is
charming, Nance. It is so delicate, child&mdash;a word here, and
a glance there&mdash;that one forgets one is middle-aged. He
spent some years in Paris, they say&mdash;to escape from his
father&#8217;s money-making and from the bleak chapel on the hill&mdash;and
I can well believe it. The French have that gift of suggesting
a grand passion, when neither actor in the comedy believes
a word of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance moved away, and looked out at the sunlight and the
sleety hills. So strong, so impulsive, was her resistance to Sir
Jasper&#8217;s wife that even the &#8220;bleak chapel on the hill&#8221;&mdash;she
knew it well, a four-square, dowdy little building not far from
her own home&mdash;took on an unsuspected strength and dignity.
It was reared out of moor-stone, at least&mdash;reared by stubborn,
if misguided, folk who were bred on the same uplands as herself.
Will Underwood had learned follies in Paris, undoubtedly;
but, if her liking for him, her care for his honour, had
any meaning, it rested on the faith that he had outgrown these
early weaknesses, that he was English to the core. He could
ride straight&mdash;there was something pathetic in her clinging
to this one, outstanding virtue&mdash;he was known among men to
be fearless, strong in all field-sports; he had endurance and a
liking for the open air. And Lady Royd, in her vague, heedless
way, had painted him as a parlour lap-dog, who could
while a pleasant hour away for women who lived in over-heated
rooms.</p>

<p>Nance was obstinate in her loyalty to friends; yet she remembered
now stray hints, odds and ends of scandal passed
between the women after dinner, while they waited for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
men to join them; and all had been agreed that Will Underwood
had the gift of making the last woman who engaged his
ardour believe she was the first.</p>

<p>Lady Royd warmed her hands at the fire again, and
laughed gently. &#8220;Why, child, you&#8217;re half in love with him,
like the rest of us. I know it by your silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Nance, whose good-humour was a byword among her
intimates, found her temper snap, like any common, ill-forged
sword might do. &#8220;By your leave,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I never did
anything by halves. My friends are my friends. I&#8217;m loyal,
Lady Royd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes&mdash;and I&mdash;am middle-aged, my dear, and the fire
grows cold already.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was appeal in the older woman&#8217;s voice. She needed
the girl&#8217;s strength, her windy, moor-swept grasp of the big
hills and the bigger faith. But Nance was full of her own
troubles, and would not heed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are dogs left at Windyhough?&#8221; she said, moving to
the door. &#8220;Well, then, let me take them for a scamper. I
cannot stay in prison, Lady Royd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance swept out of the parlour, with its faded scent of rose-leaves,
donned hat and cloak, and went out in hot rebellion to
cool her fever in the nipping wind. She did not guess how
she was needed by this frail, discontented woman she had
left indoors.</p>

<p>Lady Royd, indeed, was human&mdash;no more, no less. She
could not escape in a moment from the spoiled, settled habits
of a lifetime. Sir Jasper had ridden out, and the misery of
it had been sudden, agonising. Rupert had blundered home,
in his derelict way, with a sprained ankle and a face as white
as the hills he loved; and the motherhood in her, untrained,
suppressed, had cut through her like a knife. All was desolation
here; and she thought of her homeland&mdash;of the south
country, where winds blew soft and quiet, and lilac bloomed
before the leaf-buds had well broken here in Lancashire&mdash;and
she was hidden by a mist of desperate self-pity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>Like Rupert, when he found himself lying in the mud of
Langton Road not long ago and heard his horse go galloping
down the wind, she thought of death as an easy pathway of
escape. Like Rupert, she was not needed here. She was not
of the breed that rides out, easy in saddle, on such heroic,
foolish errands as Sir Jasper coveted. And yet, when she
came to face the matter, she had not courage, either, to die
and venture into the cold unknown beyond.</p>

<p>She had talked of Will Underwood, of his easy gallantry,
and Nance had thought her heartless; yet she had sought only
a refuge from the stress of feeling that was too hard for her
to bear.</p>

<p>She moved up and down the parlour, in her haphazard, useless
way. Her husband had ridden out on a venture high and
dangerous; and she was setting a cushion to rights here,
smoothing the fold of a curtain there, with the intentness of
a kitten that sees no farther than its playthings. But under
all there was a fierce, insistent heartache, a rebellion against
the weakness that hindered her. She began to think of Rupert,
to understand, little by little, how near together they
were, he and she. Her cowardice seemed lifted away by
friendly hands, as she told herself that she would go up and
sit at the lad&#8217;s bedside. She had known him too little in years
past; there was time now to repair mistakes.</p>

<p>Simon Foster was watching the master, as he lay in that
sleep of sheer exhaustion, following long effort and self-doubt,
which was giving him strength and respite before the morrow
needed him. Simon heard a low tapping at the door, opened
it, saw Lady Royd standing on the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he asking for me?&#8221; she said diffidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my lady. He&#8217;s asking for twelve hours o&#8217; sleep&mdash;and
he&#8217;ll get them, if I&#8217;ve any say i&#8217; the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll be tired, Simon, and I&mdash;I am wide awake. Let
me sit by him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re kind,&#8221; he interrupted bluntly; &#8220;but I&#8217;m watch-dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
here, by your leave. It happens to be war, not peace&mdash;and no
offence, my lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned, aware that a man was in command here; and
Simon was left to his interrupted musings.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the Heart,&#8221; he growled, &#8220;if only he could find his way!
He&#8217;s lean and weak; but the lad&#8217;s keen, hard-bitten pluck&mdash;it&#8217;s
killing him before his time, it is. He can find no outlet for it,
like.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE ROAD TO THE THRONE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir Jasper,</span> riding sometimes at the head of his men, at
others near the Prince, had little time for backward thoughts
during this surprising march. Each day was full of peril;
but each day, too, was full of chance humours of the road, of
those odds and ends of traffic by the way which turn men&#8217;s
thoughts from a too deep, unpractical thinking of the high
Cause only to the means by which step by step, it is to be
attained.</p>

<p>In full truth they were following the open road, these gentry
of the Prince&#8217;s. Marshal Wade was blundering down from
the north to take them in the rear. The Duke of Cumberland
was waiting for them somewhere round about the Stafford
country. They rode through villages and towns that were not
hostile&mdash;hostility is a nettle to grasp and have done with it&mdash;but
indifferent or afraid. Throughout this cold and sloppy
march, wet through, with the keen wind piping through their
sodden clothes, the greatest hardship that met them was the
lack of fierce and stubborn fight.</p>

<p>The Highlanders grew tired and listless, and Prince Charles,
who knew their temper to a nicety, for it was his own, was
forced at last to bid the pipers cease playing reels and strathspeys
down the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;With all submission, your Highness,&#8221; said Lord Murray
petulantly, riding to his side as they marched out of Lancaster,
&#8220;I would ask your reason. The pipers not to play? It is all
the comfort these Highlanders can find in England here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, riding near, saw the Prince turn, with that quick,
hardly restrained impatience which Murray&#8217;s presence always
caused. &#8220;I gave the order,&#8221; he answered, with deliberate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
calm, &#8220;because I know your Highlanders&mdash;I, who was bred
in France&mdash;better than their leaders. Give me an army in
front, my lord Murray, give me Wade, or Cumberland, or the
Elector, barring the road ahead, and the pipes shall sing, I
promise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then suddenly he threw his head up. His face, grown old
and tired, furrowed by sleepless care for his five thousand
men, was young again. He was seeing far ahead, beyond the
mud and jealousies of these wintry English roads. And again
Sir Jasper understood why the women up in Edinburgh had
gone mad about this Stuart with the yellow hair. The decent
women love a fighter always&mdash;a fighter for some cause that is
big and selfless; and the Prince&#8217;s face, just now, was lit by
some glow from the wider hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pipes shall sing,&#8221; he went on, his voice deep, tender,
hurried. &#8220;They&#8217;ll play like quicksilver, Lord Murray, when&mdash;when
the Hanover men care to meet us in the open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But meanwhile, your Highness, we&#8217;ve to trudge on, and
I say you&#8217;re forbidding meat and drink to your troops when
you&#8217;ll not let them hear the pipes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper moved his horse forward. They were alone,
the three of them, a furlong ahead of the army. Lord Murray&#8217;s
tone was so bitter, so like a scolding woman&#8217;s that Sir
Jasper&#8217;s instinct was to intervene, to take the quarrel on his
own shoulders and settle it, here by the wayside, in the honest
Lancashire way. He was checked by the Prince himself,
who returned from the hills of dreams with surprising quickness.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve to trudge on,&#8221; he said, with workaday grasp of the
affairs in hand. &#8220;You find the exact word, Lord Murray, as
your habit is. What use, then, to let the pipes go singing
music into men&#8217;s feet? We have to <i>trudge</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Murray, dour, unimaginative, possessed by a fever of jealousy
which would not let him rest, was scarcely civil. And
manners, after all, are the outward sign of character. &#8220;Your
Highness issues commands, and we obey&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>&#8220;Why, yes. I came from France to issue them,&#8221; broke in
the other, with a disdain that was royal in its quietness.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper thought of his windy house in Lancashire, of the
dreams he had fed upon, of the long preparation for this
march that was to light England with loyal fires. And he was
here, riding at a footpace through the dreary roads, watching
the rift widen between the Prince and Murray. He was oppressed
by some omen of the days to come, or by the sadness
of the Highlanders, who sought a fight and could not find it.
He had dreamed of an army&mdash;loyal, compact, looking neither
to left nor right&mdash;that would march, at speed and with a single
purpose, on London, an army that would not rest until it drove
the Hanoverian abroad. Instead, there were divided counsels,
a landscape dreary and rain-shrouded, and Murray for ever
at their elbows, sowing doubt and dull suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness,&#8221; said Sir Jasper, all in his quick, hill-bred
way, &#8220;we seem to be riding on a Lenten penance, and Christmas
is six weeks off as yet. Surely Lord Murray would be
well quit of his dourness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince turned in saddle. &#8220;My thanks, Sir Jasper,&#8221; he
said, with an easy laugh. &#8220;Lord Murray has never kept a
Lenten fast&mdash;it smacks too much of superstition, he says; but,
by the God we serve, Sir Jasper, he would likely be the better
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then Murray, seeing two against him and not relishing
the odds, lost his temper outright. &#8220;Superstition does not
carry armies on to victory,&#8221; he snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; assented the Prince, as if he reckoned up a sum in
simple addition. &#8220;But faith, my lord Murray&mdash;it carries men
far and happily.&#8221;</p>

<p>Murray checked himself with obvious effort, and they rode
on in silence for a while. &#8220;Your Highness, I spoke hastily
just now,&#8221; he said by and by. His voice, try as he would,
had no warmth in it, no true sincerity. &#8220;I ask your pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that is granted. Our royal purse is empty, but we
can still be spendthrift with forgiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>Again Sir Jasper glanced at this many-sided Prince of his.
The smile, the grave rebuke hidden beneath gentlest courtesy,
were not his own; they were gifts entrusted to his keeping by
many generations of the Stuart race. They had not always
done well or wisely, these Stuarts; but wherever down the
track of history they had touched a world made dull and
ugly by the men who lived in it, they had stood always
for the buoyant faith, the clean and eager hope, the royal
breadth of sympathy that sweeps shams and make-believes
aside.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, riding through this wet, unlovely country, found
himself once more in that mood of tenderness, of wrath and
pity, which had surprised him not long ago in Langton High
Street. The islanders of Skye&mdash;Skye, in the misty Highland
country&mdash;had known this mood from birth and were accustomed
to it, as they were used to the daily labour to win
bread, from land or sea, for their wives and bairns. But Sir
Jasper was young to it, and was disturbed by the simple, tragic
pity that seemed to cling about the Stuart&mdash;a something filmy
and impalpable, as if with him always there rode a phantom
shape of martyrdom to come.</p>

<p>He sought relief in action, glanced up and down the highway
in hope of straightforward, healthy battle. But Marshal
Wade was a good three days&#8217; march in the rear, and the Duke
of Cumberland was playing hide-and-seek along the Staffordshire
lanes without success.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper turned from looking up and down the road, and
saw Lord Murray riding close on his right. The man&#8217;s face
was set and hard; and Sir Jasper, with the intuition that comes
to tired and heart-sick men, knew that the enemy was here
among them&mdash;not in the shape of an army challenging endeavour,
but of one cautious Scotsman who was busy saving
halfpennies while guineas were going down the wind.</p>

<p>As if to prove Sir Jasper&#8217;s judgment accurate, Lord Murray
broke the silence. &#8220;You spoke of faith just now, your
Highness,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>&#8220;Why, yes&mdash;because you asked it of me. One seldom
speaks of such matters unless compelled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, with all submission, I say that faith is for kirk on
Sabbaths, for the quietness of a man&#8217;s bedchamber; but we&#8217;re
here in open war. War&mdash;I&#8217;ve seen it overseas, and have been
wounded twice&mdash;is a cold, practical affair, your Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then the Prince glanced at Sir Jasper and laughed outright,
and after that was silent for a while. &#8220;My lord Murray,&#8221;
he said quietly, &#8220;faith, mine and Sir Jasper&#8217;s, goes into
battle with us, goes into every road we take. I&#8217;m ashamed,
somehow, to speak so plainly of&mdash;of what I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I speak of what I, too, know?&#8221; put in Murray
sharply. &#8220;It is of war I speak, your Highness. I know the
rules of it&mdash;know that this hurried march of ours through
England can end only in disaster. Retreat in good order,
even now, is our only course&mdash;retreat to Scotland, where we
can gather in the clans that were slow to join us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Retreat?&#8221; said the Prince, his head lifted suddenly, his
voice ringing with command and challenge. &#8220;I never learned
the word, at school or afterwards. Retreat? My lord Murray,
there&#8217;s only one plain rule of war&mdash;to ride forward, and
plant your blow where the first opportunity serves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is our rule in Lancashire,&#8221; put in Sir Jasper dryly.</p>

<p>Murray glanced at the two of them. He had hoped much
from the cold logic that guided his days for him, had been
sure that he could persuade the Prince to his own view of the
campaign; and these two, resolute in faith and almost gay,
were treating him as if he were a stripling with much to learn
in life beyond the rules of war and mathematics.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, your Highness, that we&#8217;ve hardened troops against
us, officered by men who have grown old in strategy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet we&#8217;re here in spite of them, right through the
northern counties, and likely to keep Christmas in London.
We&#8217;re here, my lord Murray, because zeal laughs at strategy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For all that,&#8221; put in Murray dryly, &#8220;you&#8217;ll not let the pipes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
be played. They, surely, are musical with faith&mdash;your own
sort of faith, that bids men forget calculation and all else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the Prince moved impatiently in saddle. &#8220;I am not
used to give reasons for my conduct, but you shall have them
now, since you persist. My Highlanders, they take a dram to
whet their appetite for meals; but if there&#8217;s no meal waiting,
why, my lord Murray, it is idle to offer them the dram.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no fight near at hand, you mean? Your Highness,
there are three big battles that I know of&mdash;and others,
it may be&mdash;waiting close about us on this road to London.
Give the Highlanders their pipes again. Their appetite needs
sharpening if you persist in going forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince glanced at Sir Jasper. &#8220;We go forward, I
think?&#8221; he asked, with a whimsical, quick smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is our errand,&#8221; Sir Jasper answered simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Lord Murray, ride back and bid the pipers play
their fill. And I pray that one of your three phantom armies
waiting for us on the London road may prove flesh and blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Murray was exact in his calculations. He was not greatly
moved by the bagpipes, for his own part, but he knew that
they were as necessary as food and drink to the Highlanders,
who were the nerve and soul of this army following the forlornest
hope. He turned his horse and galloped back.</p>

<p>And presently the footmen&#8217;s march grew brisker; jaded
riders felt their nags move less dispiritedly under them.</p>

<p>The pipes were singing, low at first, as if a mother crooned
to her child up yonder in the misty Highlands. And then the
music and the magic grew, till it seemed that windy March
was striding, long and sinewy of limb, across the land of
lengthening days and rising sap and mating beasts and birds.
And then, again, there was a warmth and haste in the music,
a sudden wildness and a tender pity, that seemed like April
ushering in her broods along the nestling hedgerows, the
fields where lambs were playing, the banks that were gold
with primroses, and budding speedwell, and strong, young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
growth of greenstuff. And then, again, from the rear of
this tattered army that marched south to win a kingdom for
the Stuart, full June was playing round about this wet and
dismal Stafford country. The Prince knew it; Sir Jasper
knew it. Even Lord Murray, riding far behind was aware
that life held more than strategy and halfpennies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear God, the pipes!&#8221; said the Prince, turning suddenly.
&#8220;D&#8217;ye hear them, Sir Jasper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hill-bred, too, your Highness. Could I miss their
note?&#8221;</p>

<p>And they fell silent, for there is something in this hill music
that touches the soul of a man. It finds out his need of
battle, his instinct to be up and doing along the wide, human
thoroughfares of life. And then it stifles him with pity, with
homesickness and longing for the wife and bairns who, for
all that, would not approve him if he failed to take the road.
And then, again, it sounds the fighting note, till every fibre
responds to the call for instant action.</p>

<p>No action met them. They rode forward through the driving
wind, the Prince and Sir Jasper; and now the pipes, hurried
and unwearied, played only mockery about them, rousing
their strength while denying it an outlet.</p>

<p>It was then Sir Jasper heard the first and last bitter word
from the leader who had summoned him to this drear adventure.
&#8220;The pity of it!&#8221; said the Prince. &#8220;I ask only a free
hand, and they&#8217;ll not give it me. Sir Jasper, what is amiss
with Lord Murray? There was something left out of him at
birth, I think&mdash;soul, or heart&mdash;or what you choose to name
it. This march of ours&mdash;he will not listen when I tell him it
is bigger than the strict rules of warfare.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper reined near and put a hand on the Prince&#8217;s
bridle-arm, as a father might who sees his boy attempting
more than his strength warrants. &#8220;I understand,&#8221; he said
simply. &#8220;By your leave, I&#8217;ll play watch-dog to Murray
till we reach London. He stands for caution, and I&#8221;&mdash;a
sudden remembrance came to him of Windyhough, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
wife and heir, and his loneliness bit so deep that, for shame&#8217;s
sake, he had to cover up his grief&mdash;&#8220;and I, your Highness,&#8221;
he added, with a touch of humour, &#8220;have been blamed for
many things, but never yet for caution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. We might be old in friendship, you and I. We
see the like world, Sir Jasper&mdash;the world that caution is too
mean to enter. And yet my lord Murray&mdash;who has been bred
among the hills, while I have not&mdash;has never learned their
teaching, as I learned it at my first coming to the misty
Highlands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pipes would not be quiet, behind them on this sloppy
road. The Prince, as his habit was, had seen far and wisely
when he forbade the music. To and fro the uproar went,
wild, insistent, friendly as the cry of moor-birds&mdash;snipe and
curlew and wide-roving plover&mdash;to men who love the uplands.
The music lacked its fulness, for in these Midlands there
were no mountains to echo it, to pass it on from rise to rise,
till it grew faint and elfin-like among the blue moor-tops;
but even here the pipes were swift and tender with persuasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this, Sir Jasper,&#8221; the Prince said by and by&mdash;&#8220;the
pipes playing fury into us, and in front of us the empty road.
Murray promised us three battles at the least, and we&#8217;re here
like soldiers on parade.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper had cherished dreams of this Rising, but war,
in the hot fighting and in the dreary silences between, is not
made up of dreams. The poetry of it comes before and
after, when peace smooths her ruffled plumage and sings of
heroism; the prose of it is so commonplace that men sensitively
built need dogged loyalty to keep them safe from disillusionment.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind blows east, your Highness,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
pardon me, but an east wind sets my temper all on edge.
My sympathy is catholic, but I&#8217;d hang the nether millstone
round Lord Murray&#8217;s neck if I had my way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince glanced behind, because the pipes were tired of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
battle now, and were crooning lullabies&mdash;the strong, tender
cradle-songs that Highland mothers know. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said
quietly. &#8220;We share the same desire, but we&#8217;d relent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I, for one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you, for one, and I, for one, because we&#8217;re human.
So few of your English folk are human, somehow, as I&#8217;ve
seen them since my Highlanders crossed Annan River.
They&#8217;re ill-clad, these Highland lads of mine, and raw to look
at, but they carry the ready heart, Sir Jasper, and the simple
creed&mdash;you can bend them till point meets hilt, like a Ferrara
blade, and yet not break them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are tempered steel in Lancashire, your Highness,&#8221;
said Sir Jasper, in passionate defence of his county. &#8220;Few
of us have come to the Rising, but I can answer for each man
of mine that follows you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was hasty; the pipes play that mood into a man.
When we planned this Rising, years ago in France, the King&mdash;my
father&mdash;bade me remember always that Lancashire was
staunch and its women beautiful. The east wind must be
excuse for me, too, Sir Jasper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness, I spoke hastily. My temper, I tell you,
is frayed at the edges by winter and harsh weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like your temper well enough, Sir Jasper. Let&#8217;s take a
pinch of snuff together, since there&#8217;s nothing else to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was in this mood that they rode into a little village clustered
round a stream. The hamlet was so small that the
crowd of men and women gathered round about the ford
seemed bigger than its numbers. The villagers, enticed by the
news that the Rising neared their borders, raised a sudden
tumult when they saw the van of the army ride into sight.
Curiosity held them, while fear and all the rumours they had
heard prompted them to instant flight. Mothers clutched
their babies, and turned as if to run for shelter, then turned
again and halted between two minds, and must needs stay
to see what these queer Highlanders were like. The younger
women, glad of this respite from the day&#8217;s routine, ogled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Prince and Sir Jasper with unaffected candour. The men
looked on sheepishly, afraid for their own safety, but not content
to leave their women in the lurch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the cannibals from Scotland!&#8221; cried one big,
shrill-voiced woman. &#8220;They feed on English babies, so we&#8217;re
told. Dear mercy, I hope they&#8217;ve had their breakfast earlier
on the road!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince checked his horse suddenly. His face was
flushed, ashamed, as if a blow had struck him on the cheek.
&#8220;My good woman,&#8221; he said, bending from saddle to look
into her plump, foolish face, &#8220;have they lied so deep to you
as that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lies? Nay, I know what I&#8217;m talking about, or should do
at my years. There&#8217;ve been well-spoken gentry in and out
these weeks past, and they all had the same tale; so it stands
to reason the tale was true as Candlemas.&#8221; She set her arms
akimbo. The quietness of this horseman who talked to her,
his good looks and subtle air of breeding, had killed her terror
and given her instead a bravado no less foolish. &#8220;Thou&#8217;rt
well enough to look at, lad, and I wish I was younger, I do,
to kiss ye on the sly when my man didn&#8217;t happen to be looking;
but the rest o&#8217; ye, coming down the road, ye&#8217;re as
ragged a lot o&#8217; trampish folk as I&#8217;ve set eyes on.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince laughed, not happily, but as if the pipes were
bidding him weep instead. Then he plucked his mare forward&mdash;Nance
Demaine&#8217;s mare, which he had borrowed&mdash;and
splashed through the ford. And it was not till the hamlet was
a mile behind him that he turned to Sir Jasper.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lie chills me,&#8221; he said abruptly; &#8220;especially a lie that
is foisted on poor, unlettered folk. They told me this and
that, Sir Jasper, of Hanoverian methods, and I&mdash;what shall
I say?&mdash;<i>disdained</i>, I think, to believe it of an enemy. They
will not fight us in the open since we worsted them at Prestonpans,
but instead they send &#8216;well-spoken gentry&#8217; to honeycomb
the countryside with lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, the more he followed the open road with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
comrade in adversity, found ever and ever a deeper liking
for him. He could be ashamed, this Stuart whom women
had done their best to spoil in Scotland&mdash;could be ashamed
because his Highlanders were slighted; could stand apart from
his own danger and weariness, and grow hot with punctilious
care for the honour of the men who followed him. And the
older man thought no longer of Windyhough, of ties that
had not been sundered lightly; he was content to be in company
with one who, by instinct and by training, was a leader
of the true royal fibre.</p>

<p>The Prince was glancing straight ahead as they jogged
forward, and in his eyes was the look which moorland folk
know as &#8220;seeing far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Highlanders are cannibals?&#8221; he said, not turning his
head, seeming to need no listener, or to have forgotten that
he rode in company. &#8220;The men I&#8217;ve learned to know by
heart during these last wintry months&mdash;is that their reputation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a silly woman&#8217;s gibe, your Highness,&#8221; put in the
other, with blunt common sense. &#8220;Surely you&#8217;re not moved
by it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was more. They have been sending paid liars up and
down the length of this road to London&mdash;have fouled the going
for us. I tell you, Sir Jasper, that lies make me sick at
heart. I tell you an enemy that will go so far in cowardice
will afterwards do anything, I think&mdash;kill wounded men as
they lie helpless on the battlefield&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, your Highness! With all submission, your anger
carries you away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not angry&mdash;only tired and sick at heart, and seeing
far ahead. I say that I am seeing it&mdash;a bleak moor in the
Highland country, and men lying on the ground, and a rough
bullock of a man shouting, &#8216;Kill these wounded rascals; put
them out of pain!&#8217; And the wounded are&mdash;my Highlanders,
who follow me for love. There are MacDonalds and Ogilvies
and men from the Isles&mdash;I see their faces, and the resolute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
keen pain that will not flinch. The wind&#8217;s whistling down
the moor like Rachel crying for her children, and the corbie-crows
are looking on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper crossed himself with instinctive piety. So had
he felt, up yonder on the hills of Lancashire, when the winds
raved through the heather and down the glens, teaching him
sorrow, and the second sight, and the need to prove himself
a man in a world of doubt and mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;What then, your Highness?&#8221; he asked soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221; The Prince passed a hand across his eyes,
turned with the smile that drew men to his side. &#8220;Your pardon,
Sir Jasper. I&#8217;ve been up the hill o&#8217; dreams, since action
is denied me. What then? Why, the road ahead, and each
day&#8217;s hazard as it comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day, as they marched out of Leek, in Staffordshire,
Sir Jasper rode back along the line of march to see
that Maurice, his younger born, was proving himself a good
deputy in command of the Lancashire men. On his way
through the scattered units that made up this army of the
Prince&#8217;s, he was met by a Highlander who came down the
road on foot, carrying a mirror&mdash;a little, oak-framed thing
that he had begged from a cottage where they had given him
food and drink&mdash;and he was halting, now and then, to hold
it up and look into it with pious fervour. And then again
he would dance and caper like a child with a new toy before
halting for another glance at it.</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s antics were so droll, the humour of it all so
unexpected, that Sir Jasper checked his horse. &#8220;What do
you see there, my friend?&#8221; he asked, pointing to the mirror.
He spoke a little Gaelic, which he had learned, with some hardship,
from Oliphant of Muirhouse and other night-riders
who had called at Windyhough during the past years.</p>

<p>The Highlander, hearing his own tongue, spoke as to a
friend. &#8220;What do I see? My own face, and I&#8217;ve not seen
it since I left Skye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a face worth looking at,&#8221; said the other, passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
an easy jest. &#8220;You&#8217;ll not be taken&mdash;alive&mdash;by any man
in England; but I fear for you among the women.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the man laughed pleasantly. And then, with surprising
swiftness, the Skye gladness, that is never far from the
mists o&#8217; sorrow, gave way to passionate tears. &#8220;It carried
me back, this bit o&#8217; magic,&#8221; he said, in the swift, tender
speech for which there are no English words&mdash;&#8220;back to
Skye, and the blue hills i&#8217; the gloamingtide, and the maid who
would not have me at a gift. I used to go down by the burn,
where the deep pool lies under the rowans, and see my face
there&mdash;that was when I was courting Jock Sinclair&#8217;s maid
in last year&#8217;s summer, and she said I&#8217;d a face to scare crows
away with, but none for a lass that had the pick o&#8217; Skye to
choose from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you lost her, and came south to see if the yellow-haired
laddie could give you likelier work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I married her,&#8221; said the Highlander, with a gravity
complete and childlike. &#8220;She changed her mind in a week,
and we&#8217;d a bonnie wooing; and since then she&#8217;s led me the
de&#8217;il&#8217;s own dance ower dyke and ditch. And I used to get
up to the hills and play the pipes, all by my lone among the
whaups and eagles, and wish myself unwedded. And then
the Prince called me, and I had to follow; and &#8217;twas then
I knew I loved her very well.&#8221; He paused for a moment to
glance into the mirror which, to him, was the pool in Skye
where the rowans waved above the stream. &#8220;And now I&#8217;m
missing her, and the pipes go skirling, skirling, and there&#8217;s
no man at all to fight with. It&#8217;s thirsty I am to whet my
claymore for a while, and then get home again to the de&#8217;il&#8217;s
dance Jock Sinclair&#8217;s lass has waiting for me up in Skye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, by and by, rode back in search of his own
company of horse, and his thoughts ran hither and thither.
This Highlander, with the eyes and the sinewy, lean shoulders
that any man or woman might approve, this passionate
and simple child who went down the highway hugging
his mirror because it brought Skye and the wooingtide to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
mind&mdash;he was no more to these Midlands than a savage from
the northern wilds. &#8220;They feed on English babies&#8221;&mdash;the
lie set abroad by agents of a king who doubted his own cause,
the lie repeated by a lazy, unkempt woman at the village
ford, was chilling Sir Jasper now, though not long ago he
had chidden the Prince for the same fault. It was in the
breed of him to hate a lie at sight as healthy men loathe vermin.
And yet they were powerless to meet this stealthy mode
of warfare, because the Prince&#8217;s men, with all their faults,
were accustomed only to the open fight and honest tactics.</p>

<p>Then, little by little, Sir Jasper sought for the cause of all
this unrest and unhappiness that was dogging the steps of an
army that had fought Prestonpans, that had taken Carlisle,
that had marched through half England with a security which
in itself was triumph. They were heading straight for London.
The men, undaunted by forced marches, were in keen
fighting temper, asking constantly for the enemy to show
himself. Fortune was with them; the glow of old allegiance
was with them. Each league they covered was so much added
proof to the waverers that they followed a winning cause.
And yet somehow a chill was settling on them all, a cold,
intangible distrust. Sir Jasper felt it against his will. The
Prince was feeling it.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper had set out on this enterprise with a single aim;
but already his view of it was muddied a little by the politics,
the jealousies, the daily friction that creep into the conduct
of all human ventures. He could not stand far off, as yet,
from the bigness and simplicity of the dreams he had nursed
at Windyhough. Up yonder on the moors, as he mapped
out the campaign, it had been a gallop against odds, a quick
battle, death on the field, or a ride into London to see the
Stuart crowned with fitting pomp and thanksgiving. And
instead, there had been these days and days of marching at
a foot pace, without a chance skirmish to enliven them&mdash;days
spent in ploughing through roads fetlock-deep in mud, with the
east wind harrying them like a scolding tongue, days spent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
watching the leaders of the Highland clans drifting each day
nearer to the whirlpool of unrest that revolved about Lord
Murray.</p>

<p>The men who passed Sir Jasper, as he rode back to join his
company, were awed by the sheer fury in his face. He did
not see them. Kilted men on foot met him, and Lowlanders
in tattered breeks, riding nags as rough-coated as themselves.
And some from the pick of Scotland&#8217;s chivalry glanced at him
for a nod of recognition, and saw him looking straight ahead
with murder in his eyes.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper was in the mood that, now and then, had frightened
his wife up yonder on the moors of Lancashire. He
had kept the Faith. He had given up wife and bairns and
lands if things chanced to go astray. And there was one man
in this Rising who was the traitor in their midst. Scholarly,
yet simple in his piety, Sir Jasper was in the thick of that
stormy mood which hillmen know&mdash;a mood pitiless and keen
as the winds bred in the hollows of the wintry moor, a mood
that goes deeper than training, and touches, maybe, the bedrock
of those stormy passions known to the forefathers of
the race when all the heath was lit with feuds.</p>

<p>It was now that good luck found Sir Jasper. There was
an empty stretch of road in front of him. He was alone
with the black mood that he hated&mdash;the mood he could not
kill; and the bitter wind was finding out the weak places in
a body not too young. And then round the bend of the highway
rode Lord Murray; and Sir Jasper felt a little stir of
gladness, as if the wind had shifted to a warmer quarter.</p>

<p>Murray was unaccompanied, save for his aide-de-camp&mdash;a
careless, pleasant-faced youth of twenty, Johnstone by name,
who was destined afterwards to write a diverting and boyishly
inaccurate account of a campaign whose shallows only,
not its depths, were known to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all men, I&#8217;ve hoped most to meet you, my lord Murray,&#8221;
said Sir Jasper, drawing rein. &#8220;Your friend can ride
apart; I&#8217;ve much to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>Murray, too, drew rein, glanced hard and uncivilly at Sir
Jasper, and turned with a smile to his aide-de-camp. &#8220;The
Lancashire manner is curt, Mr. Johnstone,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What
is this gentleman&#8217;s name again? He joined us at Langton, I
remember, and his Highness was pleased to overdo the
warmth of his greeting. It is a way the Prince has, and it
answers well enough with the women, to be sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Jasper Royd,&#8221; broke in the other, his temper
at a smooth white heat, &#8220;and it is entirely at your service
after this campaign is ended. I permit no man to sneer at
his Highness, and you&#8217;ll give me satisfaction later.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Murray took a pinch of snuff, smiled again behind
his hand at Johnstone. &#8220;There&#8217;s something&mdash;what shall I
say, sir?&mdash;something old-fashioned in your loyalty, though it
sits well enough on you, if &#8217;twere a play we acted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My loyalty is&mdash;just loyalty. There&#8217;s no change of fashion
can alter the clean faith of a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon, but was this all you had to say to me? The
wind is shrewd, Sir Jasper, and we can discuss loyalty&mdash;and
punctilio and the duel you are eager for&mdash;when we next find
an inn to shelter us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Murray&#8217;s harsh, narrow egotism had seldom shown to
worse advantage than now. Since first Sir Jasper rode into
Langton Street with the big air about him that simple-minded
gentlemen are apt to carry, since Murray had seen the
Prince&#8217;s welcome, his jealousy had taken fire. It had slumbered
during the last days of hardship, but this meeting on
the road had quickened it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had more to say, much more,&#8221; Sir Jasper answered,
quiet and downright. &#8220;Again I ask you to bid Mr. Johnstone
ride behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, by your leave; he has my full confidence. You
may speak your mind at once; but be speedy, for I would
remind you that this is not midsummer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Johnstone laughed, as youth will at unlikely times;
and the laugh added a fine edge to Sir Jasper&#8217;s temper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>&#8220;Then, as you&#8217;ll have it so, Mr. Johnstone shall be a
listener. It is of this Rising I mean to speak&mdash;and of your
share in it. You are young, Lord Murray, and I am getting
old. You&#8217;re riding to the warfare you learned in set battles
overseas, but we&mdash;the Prince, God bless him! and the Highlanders
and my good lads from Lancashire&mdash;are out on a
wider road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will explain?&#8221; drawled Murray.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye think five thousand of us, ill-armed, can win to
London by rules of war and maps and compasses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not think from the first we had a chance of reaching
London,&#8221; snapped the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; put in Sir Jasper adroitly. &#8220;We knew as much.
You said, before Annan was reached, that we&#8217;d no chance
of getting beyond Carlisle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; said Murray, flurried and unguarded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oliphant of Muirhouse, who never lies, my lord. Well,
we&#8217;re here in Staffordshire, and the London road still open
to us; and your prophecy, somehow, has miscarried.&#8221;</p>

<p>Murray grew fidgety. Hot temper he knew, and suavity
he knew, but not this subtle mixture of the two. &#8220;Thank
our good luck for that. They say Heaven guards all fools.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But more especially all true believers. That is my
point. We&#8217;re adventurers, Lord Murray, not seasoned troops.
We ride by faith, we ride for love of the Prince, of what
he stands for&mdash;and we have come through odds that cautious
generals would shirk&mdash;but we are here, in Staffordshire, and
the London road, I say, is open to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, it&#8217;s a sermon, after all, you wish to preach.
The clergy, my good Sir Jasper, are wiser than you; they
preach between four snug walls that shut off this cursed
wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a sermon,&#8221; said Sir Jasper doggedly. &#8220;I preach
common sense, to one whose faith is dulled by tactics.&#8221;</p>

<p>Murray lost the bullying air that had carried him fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
well through life. He felt dwarfed, ashamed, by some quality
in Sir Jasper that overrode his self-importance and trampled
it in the mire. &#8220;Sir Jasper,&#8221; he asked sullenly, &#8220;may
I ask you for plain speech? What is your quarrel with
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask for plain speech? And you&#8217;ll not ask Mr. Johnstone
to ride out of earshot? No? Then he, too, shall listen
to plain speech.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence. Murray wondered at the
tense, lean carriage of this Lancashire squire, whose loyalty
had been a jest among the cynics of the army, but for the
others a steady beacon-light. He wondered more that Sir
Jasper&#8217;s face, grey and lined a while since, was comely now
in its heat and youthfulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say&mdash;deliberately, my lord&mdash;that you&#8217;re the Judas in
this enterprise. I&#8217;m getting old, as I said, and I&#8217;ve looked
about me during these last days, and I speak of what I know.&#8221;
His temper cooled suddenly, but not his purpose. There was
no pleasure now in lashing Murray&mdash;only the need to do his
duty, as if he were bidden to shoot a deserter, made up of
the same human clay and the same human frailty as he who
pressed the trigger. &#8220;The Highlanders&mdash;the rank and file&mdash;you
cannot reach. But their leaders, my lord Murray&mdash;you
know as well as I that you&#8217;re at work each day undermining
the faith of better men and cleaner-hearted soldiers than yourself.
It&#8217;s no secret that you wish to retreat&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To retreat, the better to spring forward,&#8221; put in Murray,
with half-hearted effrontery.</p>

<p>&#8220;To <i>retreat</i>, I said. The Prince goes forward always. It
is his habit. You&#8217;ve won many of the Highland chiefs to
your side, but the best of them you cannot tempt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are curiously exact in your knowledge of my doings,&#8221;
sneered Murray.</p>

<p>&#8220;I made it my business since the day I first set eyes on you
at Langton. That is neither here nor there. And yet there
are some of us you cannot tempt. The Duke of Perth&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, he, too, is mediæval,&#8221; snarled Murray. &#8220;You and
he are out of date, Sir Jasper, and I tell you so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again young Johnstone laughed, though at heart his sympathy
and liking went out to this queer, downright squire
from Lancashire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Lochiel,&#8221; went on Sir Jasper buoyantly&mdash;&#8220;is he,
too, old and out of date? Lochiel&mdash;you know how the very
name of him sings music to the Highlanders. Lochiel&mdash;dear
God! the tears are in my eyes; he&#8217;s so like the free open
moors I&#8217;ve left behind me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Murray&#8217;s thin lips came together. It was plain now where
the weakness lay in a face that otherwise was strong and
manly. The mouth was that of a nagging woman querulous,
undisciplined, lined with bygone sneers. He was jealous of
the Prince&mdash;jealous of this fine, upstanding squire who spoke
his mind with disconcerting openness; but, most of all, he
was jealous of Lochiel&mdash;Lochiel, the whisper of whose name
set fire to loyal Highlandmen; Lochiel, who was gay and
courtly and a pleasant comrade; Lochiel, who was hard as
granite when men touched his inner faith; he was all that
Lord Murray hated, all that Murray wished to be, and could
not be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Jasper, you&#8217;ve been plain of speech,&#8221; he said, with
sudden fury. &#8220;Our quarrel need not be delayed. I ask Mr.
Johnstone here if I can wait to give you satisfaction&mdash;until&#8221;&mdash;again
the smile that was a sneer&mdash;&#8220;until after we are all
beheaded on Tower Hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper glanced up and down the road. They had it
to themselves, though at any moment a company might ride
into view along the straggling route. It was a grave breach
of discipline, this duel in the midst of warfare; and yet,
somehow, he found it welcome. He turned to the aide-de-camp,
glanced quietly at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Johnstone,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you cannot be friendly to
Lord Murray and myself&mdash;it&#8217;s too wide a gulf for young legs
to jump&mdash;but I can trust you, by the look of you, to see fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
play between us. I have no friend at hand, and it happens
that this business must be settled quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>They rode apart from the route, into a little wood where
sycamores and oaks were bending to the keen, whipping
gale. They found an open space, and got from horse, and
took off their coats. To Lord Murray, a good swordsman,
it was a chance to put out of action one who, in breed and
temper, was too near akin to the Stuart and Lochiel. To Sir
Jasper it was a call, clear, unhurried, to remove a traitor
from the midst of honest men.</p>

<p>They faced each other in the little glade. Murray was
mathematical, exact, secure in his gift of fence. Sir Jasper
was as God made him&mdash;not reckoning up the odds, but trusting
that honesty would win the day. Young Johnstone
watched; and, despite himself, his heart ached for the older
man who pitted Lancashire swordcraft against Murray&#8217;s practised
steel.</p>

<p>The fight was quick and brief; and the unexpected happened,
as it had done throughout this march of faith against
surprising odds. Sir Jasper was not fighting for his own
hand, but for the Prince&#8217;s; and his gift of fence&mdash;to himself,
who knew how time had rusted his old bones&mdash;was a thing
magical, as if a score of years or so had been lifted from his
shoulders.</p>

<p>At the end of it he got clean through Murray&#8217;s guard; and
it was now that the duel grew dull and tragic to him, robbed
altogether of its speed, its pleasant fire. He had fought for
this one moment; he had his chance to strike wherever he
chose, to kill or lay aside the worst enemy Prince Charles had
found, so far, in England. And yet, somehow, his temper
was chilled, and the struggle with himself, short as the flicker
of an eyelid, seemed long, because it was so sharp and bitter.
With an effort that was palpable to young Johnstone, looking
on, he drew back his blade, rested its point in the sodden
turf, and stood looking at his adversary.</p>

<p>The action was so deliberate, so unexpected, that Murray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
let his own point fall; and even he was roused for the moment
from his harshness. He knew that this Lancashire squire,
with the uncompromising tongue and the old-fashioned view
of loyalty, had given him his life just now&mdash;had given it with
some sacrifice of inclination&mdash;knew that, in this wet and out-of-the-way
corner of the world, he was face to face with a
knightliness that he had thought dead long ago.</p>

<p>And then Sir Jasper grew ashamed, in some queer way, of
the impulse that had bidden him let Murray go unscathed.
He sheathed his sword, bowed stiffly, untethered his horse,
and got to saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you good-day, Lord Murray,&#8221; he said curtly.
&#8220;God bring you nearer to the Prince in days to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Murray watched him ride through the glade, out toward
the open road where wayfaring loyalists were on the march.
And from his shame and trouble a quiet understanding grew.
His starved soul was quickened. A gleam from the bigger
life cut across his precision, his self-importance, his gospel
of arithmetic.</p>

<p>His aide-de-camp looked on. Johnstone was unused to the
tumults that beset older heads; and he had made a hero of
this man who had been defeated&mdash;a little more than defeated&mdash;at
his own game of swordcraft. And he was puzzled because
Murray did not curse his fortune, or bluster, or do
anything but stand, hilt to the ground, as if he were in a
dream.</p>

<p>It was all quick in the doing. Murray got himself in
hand, shrugged his shoulders, searched for his snuff-box.
&#8220;This is all very dismaying, Mr. Johnstone,&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;I
said from the start that we were forgetting every rule of
warfare in this mad Rising. And yet&mdash;to be honest, Sir
Jasper is something near to what I dreamed of before the
world tired me&mdash;he&#8217;s very like a man, Mr. Johnstone. And
there are few real men abroad these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper himself, as he rode back into the highway, was
in a sad and bitter mood. He had spoken his mind, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
fought and won the duel he had welcomed, and reaction was
telling heavily on him just now. After all, he had done more
harm than good by this meeting with Lord Murray. Private
quarrels, carried as far as this had been, were treasonable,
because they weakened all the discipline and speed of an
attack against the common enemy. Moreover, a man of
Murray&#8217;s temper could never understand how serviceable it
is to admit defeat, and forget it, and go forward with the
business of the day; he would plant the grudge, would tend
and water it, till it grew from a sapling into a lusty, evil
tree.</p>

<p>He drew rein as he came through the ill-found bridle-track
into the open road. Scattered men, on horse or on foot,
passed by him; for the fight in the wood had been brief, and
an army of five thousand takes long to straggle over
slushy, narrow highways. And then Sir Jasper&#8217;s face grew
cheery on the sudden. A company, in close and decent order,
rode into view. He saw Lancashire faces once again&mdash;his
son&#8217;s, and Squire Demaine&#8217;s, and Giles the bailiff&#8217;s, and fifty
others that he knew by heart.</p>

<p>They met him at the turning of the way, drew up, saluted
him. And Sir Jasper found his big, spacious air again, because
he was at home with men who knew his record&mdash;with
men reared, like himself, within sight of Pendle&#8217;s round and
friendly hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re full of heart, lads from Lancashire,&#8221; he said, taking
the salute as if he led a pleasant partner out to dance the
minuet. &#8220;By gad! we&#8217;re full of heart, I tell you,&#8221; he broke
off, with sharp return to his habit of command. &#8220;The London
road is open to the Prince; there are three armies chasing
us, so I&#8217;m told, but they seem to shun close quarters.
Lancashire men, I&#8217;m old, and all my bones are aching&mdash;and
yet I&#8217;m gay. Giles, your face is sour as cream in thunder
weather; Maurice, though you&#8217;re my son, you look lean and
shrivelled, as if the wind had nipped you; is it only the old
men of this Rising who are full of heart?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>&#8220;We&#8217;re spoiling for a fight, sir,&#8221; said Maurice, with a
boy&#8217;s outspoken fretfulness, &#8220;and instead there&#8217;s only this
marching through dull roads, and no hazards to meet us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No heroics, you mean,&#8221; broke in Squire Demaine, who
was riding close beside Maurice. &#8220;See you, my lad, this is
open war,&#8221; he went on&mdash;gruffly, because he, too, was weary of
inaction. &#8220;And war is not the thing the ballads sing about.
It&#8217;s not crammed with battles, and all the ladies watching,
ready with tears and lollipops for the wounded; it&#8217;s a bleak
affair of marching, with little porridge and less cream to it&mdash;until&mdash;until
you&#8217;re sick from hunger and fatigue. And then
the big battle comes&mdash;and it sorts out the men from the weaklings.
And that is war, I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper reined up beside him, and the two older men
rode forward, and the interrupted march moved stolidly again
along the road to London&mdash;pad of hoofs, slush of tired footmen
through the sleety mire, whinnying of dispirited horses
and murmur of round Lancashire oaths from the farmers
who had left plough and fieldwork behind them, as they
thought, and were finding the like dour routine on this highway
where no adventures met them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You heartened our men just now&mdash;and, gad! they needed
it,&#8221; said Squire Demaine, as they trotted out of earshot.
&#8220;But you carry a sad face, old friend, for all that. What
ails you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Murray ails me,&#8221; snapped the other. &#8220;He&#8217;s like
a pestilence among us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re precise. He is a pestilence. If we could persuade
Marshal Wade&mdash;or George&mdash;to take him as a gift,
why, we&#8217;d reach London sooner. Give away a bad horse, if
you can&#8217;t sell him, and let him throw the other man&mdash;there&#8217;s
wisdom in the old saws yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed, Demaine,&#8221; said Sir Jasper, turning suddenly.
&#8220;You gave Maurice sound advice just now, when he
was headstrong and asking for a battle as children cry for
toys. And yet it was I who needed your reproof.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>And then he told of his meeting with Lord Murray on the
road, of the fury that he could not check, of the duel in the
wood. His tale was told so simply, with such diffidence and
surety that he had been in the wrong, that Squire Demaine
laughed gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to your discredit, surely, in all this,&#8221; he
said&mdash;&#8220;except that you spared the Prince&#8217;s evil-wisher. Gad!
I wish my blade had been as near Murray&#8217;s heart. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would have done as I did. We know each other&#8217;s
weaknesses, Demaine&mdash;that is why our friendship goes so
deep, may be. You&#8217;d have done as I did. We relent&mdash;as
soon as we are sure that we have proved our case&mdash;have
proved it to the hilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then Squire Demaine blustered a little, and denied the
charge, then broke into a laugh that was heard far back along
the line of march.</p>

<p>&#8220;Squire&#8217;s found his hunting-laugh again,&#8221; said one Lancashire
yeoman to his neighbour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye. We need it, lad,&#8221; the other answered. &#8220;There&#8217;s
been no hunting these last days.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Squire himself rode silently beside his friend, then
turned in saddle. &#8220;Yes, we relent,&#8221; he said, with his happy-go-lucky
air. &#8220;Is that our weakness, Royd&mdash;or our
strength?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know.&#8221; Sir Jasper&#8217;s smile was grave and questioning.
&#8220;The devil&#8217;s sitting on my shoulders and I do not
know. A week since I&#8217;d have said that faith&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, faith. We hold it fast&mdash;we know it true&mdash;but, to
be honest, I&#8217;ve lost my bearings. I&#8217;d have dealt more gently
with Maurice if I&#8217;d not shared his own longing for a fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith is a practical affair.&#8221; Sir Jasper was cold and self-reliant
again, as when he had fought with Murray in the
wood. &#8220;When the road is at its worst, and sleet blows up
from the east, and we ask only to creep into the nearest ditch,
and die as cowards do&mdash;when all seems lost. Demaine&mdash;surely,
if faith means anything at all, it means&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;re more devout than I,&#8221; snapped the Squire. &#8220;So
is the Prince. I talked with him yesterday. He was wet to
the skin, and had just given his last dram of brandy to one
Hector MacLean who had cramp in the stomach&mdash;and I was
hasty, may be, as I always am when I see royalty of any sort
go beggared. &#8216;Your Highness,&#8217; I said, &#8216;the Blood Royal
should receive, not give, and you needed that last dram, by
the look of your tired face.&#8217; And what did he answer, think
ye? &#8216;You&#8217;ve an odd conception of royalty, sir,&#8217; said the
Prince, his eyes hard and tender both. &#8216;The Blood Royal&mdash;my
father&#8217;s and mine&mdash;gives till it can give no more. It
lives, or it dies&mdash;but it goes giving to the last hour.&#8217; He&#8217;s a
bigger man than I am, Royd.&#8221;</p>

<p>They jogged forward. And presently Sir Jasper broke the
silence. &#8220;We are hurrying to dodge two armies, and we&#8217;re
succeeding; would God they&#8217;d both find us, here on the road,
and give us battle! That is our need. One battle against
odds&mdash;and our men riding free and keen&mdash;and Murray would
find his answer. I&#8217;d rather be quit of him that way than&mdash;than
by striking at the bared breast of the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, I know,&#8221; murmured the Squire, seeing how hard
Sir Jasper took this battle in the wood. &#8220;Let Murray run
his neck into the nearest halter; he&#8217;s not fair game for honest
gentlemen. You were right. And yet&mdash;my faith runs low,
I tell you, and you might have spared a better man. The
mouth of him&mdash;I can see it now, like a rat&#8217;s, or a scolding
woman&#8217;s&mdash;you&#8217;ve a tenderer conscience than I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Into the middle of their trouble rode Maurice, tired of shepherding
men who blamed him because he found no battle
for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sorry that Rupert could not ride with us,&#8221; he said,
challenging Sir Jasper&#8217;s glance.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper winced, for his heir was dear to him beyond the
knowledge of men who have never bred a son to carry on the
high traditions of a race. &#8220;If pluck could have brought him,
he&#8217;d have been with us, Maurice,&#8221; he said sharply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>&#8220;I was not denying his pluck, sir; he gave me a taste of
it that day he fought like a wild cat on the moor.&#8221; His face
flushed, for he had not known, until the separation came,
how deep his love went for his brother. The novelty and uproar
of the march had stifled his heartache for a day or two,
but since then he had missed Rupert at every turn. &#8220;It was
because I&mdash;because I know his temper, sir,&#8221; he went on, with
a diffidence unlike his usual, quick self-reliance. &#8220;He&#8217;d have
been all for high faith, and a battle at the next road-corner;
and these days of trudging through the sleet would have maddened
him. I&#8217;m glad he stayed at home. He&#8217;d have picked
a quarrel long since with one of our own company, just to
prove his faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>Squire Demaine glanced dryly at Sir Jasper. &#8220;The young
pup and the old pup, Royd. Maurice here has better judgment
than I thought. I always said that Rupert was true to
the Royd breed. Your own encounter in the wood just
now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your encounter, sir?&#8221; broke in Maurice eagerly. &#8220;Giles
was saying to me just now that he&#8217;d rather be riding on his
bailiff&#8217;s business up among the hills than be following this
dog-trot through the rain. He said&mdash;and he was so quiet
that I knew his temper was red-raw&mdash;he said that naught was
ever like to happen again, so far as he could see, and he was
longing for a thunderstorm, just to break up the quietness,
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy was so apt in his mimicry of Giles that Squire
Demaine gave out the frank, hearty bellow that did duty for
a laugh. &#8220;We&#8217;re all of the same mind, my lad. Thunder&mdash;or
a straight, soon over fight&mdash;clears up one&#8217;s troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your encounter, father?&#8221; said Maurice, persistent in his
curiosity. &#8220;Did you meet a spy of George&#8217;s, and kill him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper looked at this younger-born of his, at the frank,
open face and sturdy limbs. And then he thought, with that
keen, recurrent stab of pain that had been bedfellow to him
since first he knew his heir a weakling, of Rupert, left up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Windyhough to guard a house that&mdash;so far as he could see
just now&mdash;was in need of no defence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not&mdash;not just a spy of George&#8217;s I met,&#8221; he said,
with a grave smile. &#8220;He may come to that one day. And
I did not kill him, Maurice, though I had the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sir?&#8221; said Maurice, downright and wondering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? God knows. We&#8217;d best be pushing forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Windyhough, where the wind had piled a shroud of
snow about the gables, they were thinking, all this time, that
those who had ridden out were fortunate. As day by day
went by, and Rupert found himself constantly alone in a
house where only women and old men were left, he found it
harder to stay at home, drilling the household to their separate
parts in an attack whose likelihood grew more and more remote.</p>

<p>Rupert, with a body not robust and a twisted ankle that
was still in bandages, was holding fast to his allegiance. His
mother, less pampered and less querulous, grew each day a
more sacred trust. Each day, as she watched him go about the
house, he surprised more constantly that look of the Madonna
which stood out against the background of her pretty, faded
face. He had something to defend at last, something that
played tender, stifled chords about that keyboard which we
call the soul. He was alone among the women and the old
men; but he was resolute.</p>

<p>And then there came a night when he had patrolled the
house, had looked out through his window, before getting to
bed, for a glance at the hilltops, white under a shrouded moon.
He was tired, was seeking an answer to his faith. And, instead,
a darkness came about him, a denial of all he had hoped
for, prayed and striven for. Hope went by him. Trust in
God grew dim and shadowy. There was no help, in this
world or another, and he was a weak fool, as he had always
been, drifting down the path of the east wind.</p>

<p>He recalled, with pitiless clearness, how he had played
eavesdropper before the Rising men rode out, had heard his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
father say that no attack on Windyhough was possible, that
the guns and ammunition were nursery toys he had left his
heir to play with in his absence.</p>

<p>Rupert&mdash;namesake of a cavalier whose name had never
stood for wisdom, but always for high daring&mdash;stood with
bowed shoulders, unmanned and desolate. He did not know
that the wise, older men he reverenced were compelled to
stand, time and time, as he was doing, with black night and
negation at their elbow. He knew only that it was cold and
dark, with no help at hand. It is moments such as this that
divide true men from the feeble-hearted; and Rupert lifted
his head, and, though he only half believed it, he told himself
that dawn would follow this midwinter night.</p>

<p>And that night he slept like a child, and dreamed that all
was well. And he woke the next day to find Simon Foster
watching by his bedside, patient and trusty as the dogs whose
instinct is toward loyalty.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve slept, maister!&#8221; said Simon. &#8220;By th&#8217; Heart, I
never saw a body sleep so sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must patrol the house, Simon. The attack is coming&mdash;and
we&#8217;ll not be late for it, after all these days of
waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who says the attack is coming?&#8221; growled the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dreamed it&mdash;the clearest dream I ever had, Simon.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Simon shook his head. He had no faith in dreams.</p>

<small>THE STAY-AT-HOMES</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Winter</span> is not always rough on the high moors of Lancashire.
There are days when the wind creeps into hiding,
and the sun comes up into a sky of blue and saffron, and
the thrush begins to find his mating-note before its time.
The gnats steal out from crannies in the walls, making pretence
of a morris-dance along the slant rays of the sun; and
everywhere there is a pleasant warmth and bustle, as if faith
in this far-off summer, after all, had easily survived the east
wind&#8217;s spite.</p>

<p>It was on such a day&mdash;the breeze soft from the west, and
Pendle Hill all crimson in the sunset&mdash;that Rupert limped
out from Windyhough on the crutch that Simon Foster had
made for him. He had gone his round of the house&mdash;that
empty round performed for duty&#8217;s sake twice every day&mdash;and
he was hungry for the smell of the open country. He hobbled
up the pastures, as far as the rough lands where the moor
and the intaken fields were fighting their old, unyielding
battle&mdash;a feud as old as the day when the first heath-man
drove his spade into the heather and began to win a scanty
living from the wilderness for wife and bairns.</p>

<p>Rupert, the dreamer, who had stood apart from life, had
always found his sanctuary here, where the broken lands lay
troubled, like himself, between the desert and the harvest.
Instinct had led him here to-night, though weakness of body,
never far from him, was trying once again to sap his courage.</p>

<p>He looked across the moor, strong and comely in its winter
nakedness. He watched a cock-grouse whirr across the
crimson sun-rays. And then, with a sense of thanksgiving
and security, he saw the round, stalwart bulk of Pendle Hill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
There is something about Pendle&mdash;a legacy from the far-off
fathers, may be&mdash;that goes deep to the heart of Lancashire
men. Its shape is not to be mistaken. It stands like a
rounded watch-tower, guarding the moors where freedom and
rough weather go hand in hand. It has seen many fights
of men&mdash;feuds, and single-handed combats, and stealthy ambushes&mdash;and
has come, stalwart and upstanding, through
weather that would have daunted meaner souls. It has
the strong man&#8217;s gift of helping weaker men along the
gallant, uphill climb that stretches from the cradle to the
stars.</p>

<p>Pendle Hill, big above the wilderness of bog and heath,
never chatters of destiny, never tells a man that life is hard,
that he had best be done with it, that all his striving has been
so much useless labour. Pendle, the fairest citadel of Lancashire,
has won through too many generations of cold and
hardship to be daunted by the troubles of one man&#8217;s lifetime.
Rugged, round to the wide, wind-swept skies, old
Pendle keeps the faith, and will not yield.</p>

<p>Rupert had yet to win his spurs, he thought. And yet,
as Pendle Hill viewed the matter, he had won them long
ago. Day by day, year by year, through his unhappy and
disastrous boyhood, the lad had come to the windy lands, for
strength and solace. He had been loyal to the hills, steadfast
when stronger men had taken their ease. And to-night, because
it saw a soldier in the making, gruff Pendle sent out
a welcome to Sir Jasper&#8217;s heir.</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows me for a fool,&#8221; said Rupert, afraid of the new
message that had reached him.</p>

<p>And there was stillness, while the sun&#8217;s red died behind
the moor. No voice answered Rupert&#8217;s challenge to the
over-world; but, for all that, he limped down to Windyhough
with a sense that all the birds were singing. Through the
misery and darkness of these days he was reaching out, with
stubborn gallantry, to grasp the forward hope. The forward
hope! He had lived on little else since he was breeked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>As he came down to Windyhough, he met Nance and old
Simon Foster at the courtyard gate; Simon was carrying a
musket, and polishing the barrel with his sleeve as he hobbled
at the girl&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve news for you, Rupert!&#8221; she said gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of the Rising?&#8221; He was eager, possessed of the one
thought only. &#8220;Is trouble nearing Windyhough? Nance,
is there real work to be done at last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear, you ask too much. Nothing ever happens
at Windyhough; nothing will ever happen again, I think.
We&#8217;re derelict, Rupert; the Highlandmen are playing their
Prince into his kingdom by this time, and we&#8221;&mdash;she grew
bitter, petulant, for the silence and the waiting were sapping
her buoyant health, her courage, her trust in high endeavour&mdash;&#8220;and
we in Lancashire are churning our butter every week,
Rupert, and selling cows on market days, and dozing by the
hearth. <i>I am ashamed.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Simon Foster glanced sharply at Rupert. He knew the
lad through and through, was prepared for the whiteness of
his face, the withdrawal as if a friend had struck him wantonly.
&#8220;Miss Nance,&#8221; he said bluntly, &#8220;shame is for folk
that&#8217;s earned it. There&#8217;s three of us here, and we&#8217;d all be
marching into London, if only it could have happened that
way, like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance would not look at Rupert, though she guessed how
she had wounded him. She did not know this mood that had
settled on her since coming to the draughty, loyal house of
Windyhough. The long inaction, the waiting for news gathered
from gruff, hard-ridden messengers, the day-long wish
to be out in the thick of battle, had troubled her; but there
was a deeper trouble&mdash;a trouble that was half delight, a turmoil
and unrest to which she could not give a name. And
the trouble centred round Rupert. She liked him so well,
had grown up with his queer, dreamy ways, his uncomplaining
courage.</p>

<p>She had laughed at him, had pitied him; but now she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
pitying herself. If only he would remember that he was a
man, the heir to a fine, loyal record&mdash;if only he would clear
the cobwebs from his eyes, and sit a horse as other men did,
would show the stuff his soul was made of, the world would
understand him at long last.</p>

<p>Nance was tired, her temper out of hand. &#8220;Simon, you
can go indoors,&#8221; she said dryly. &#8220;Since you did not join
the Rising&mdash;why, Lady Royd has work for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not know what she needed, or what ailed her.
And she and Rupert stood in the courtyard after old Simon
had gone in, fronting each other like wary duellists.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was your news?&#8221; asked Rupert, his temper brittle
like her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we set up a target, Simon and I; and I practised
with one of your clumsy muskets, Rupert, and wished that I
had a bow-and-arrow in my hands instead. I have some skill
in archery, have I not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You&#8217;ve skill in all things, Nance. There&#8217;s no news
in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I aimed very wide at first, till I turned and found
Simon smiling as if he were watching a baby at its play. So
then I kept him hard at work&mdash;loading, and priming, and the
rest, and wasted a good deal of your ammunition, Rupert&mdash;but
I learned to hit the target.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke lightly, hurriedly, as if fearing to sound the
depths of this trouble that had come between Rupert and
herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it just to pass the time?&#8221; he asked by and by.
&#8220;You&#8217;re shut in here and restless, I know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was more, perhaps. We are so few, and I said just
now that nothing would ever happen again at Windyhough&mdash;but
the attack may come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert glanced at his crutch. He was sensitive, from long
suffering, to the least hint that touched his personal infirmities.
&#8220;And you could not trust your men to guard you?&#8221;
he said sharply. &#8220;That was your thought?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, Rupert, no! I&#8217;m out of heart&mdash;I did not mean to
hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve not hurt me, Nance. I&mdash;I must find Simon and
go the round of the house with him. We call it our drill.&#8221;
He turned at the door, glanced at her with the smile of self-derision
that she knew. &#8220;Simon is right. He says that, if a
man can&#8217;t go soldiering, the next best thing is to play at it,
like a bairn with a wooden sword. Good-night, Nance. I&#8217;m
tired, and shall get to bed after seeing to the defences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance heard the delicate irony as he spoke of the defences,
saw him limp into the house. And some new feeling came
to her. It was not pity; it was a strange, fugitive pride in
the courage that could keep so harassed a spirit under control.
She had been harsh and bitter, had wounded him because
she needed any outlet from these pent-up days at
Windyhough; and he had gathered his little strength together,
had laughed at himself, had gone to the routine of guarding
a house that did not need defence.</p>

<p>Nance was ashamed to-night. Her reliance and high
spirits had deserted her; and for that reason she saw nearer
to the heart of life. She felt that a great gentleman, marred
in the making, had gone into this house of fine traditions.
She asked, with an entreaty passionate and wilful as herself,
why Rupert had been condemned to sit at home among
the women, when so little more was needed to shape him to
the comely likeness of a man.</p>

<p>And then she thought of Will Underwood, who had
strength and grace of body, remembered with obstinate zeal
her faith that he had ridden on some desperate business of
the Rising, though men doubted him. And she was in the
turmoil of first love again.</p>

<p>The next day, and the next, she missed Rupert from the
house. He would go his rounds punctiliously after breakfast,
and then would take a crust and a piece of cheese in his
pocket and limp up into the hills. She thought that he was
feeding his dreams, as of old, on the high winds and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
high legends of the heath; and she missed him, with a sense
of loneliness that would not let her rest.</p>

<p>Simon Foster, too, was absent these days, and Lady Royd
grew petulant. Though her husband was like to lose his
head, and England was stirred by that throb of coming battle
which is like thunder-heat before the rain and lightning come,
she was troubled because Simon did not perform his indoor
duties. For she, who had little guidance of herself, and
therefore less control of serving-folk, was exact in her demand
that all the details of the house should be well-ordered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought Simon at least tied by rheumatism to the
house,&#8221; she wailed to Nance, on the second day of absence;
&#8220;but he&#8217;s like all our men&mdash;off to the Rising, or off to the
fields; any excuse will serve, it seems, when women feel their
indoor loneliness.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Nance, though her impulse was to laugh, was subdued
by those blundering, poignant words, &#8220;their indoor
loneliness.&#8221; Nance was a child of the open fields, meeting
all chances of life better in the free wind than in the stifled
houses. Not until her coming to Windyhough had she understood
the heartache, the repression, summed up by &#8220;their
indoor loneliness.&#8221; A fierce resentment took hold of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men have all the pleasure,&#8221; she said, in a low, hard voice.
&#8220;It was so always.&#8221;</p>

<p>She would have been the better for a glimpse of the
Prince&#8217;s tattered army, fighting through sleet and mud and
jealousy for the privilege of setting a Stuart on the throne.
But Nance was young and untried yet, and thought herself
ill-used because she had a roof above her.</p>

<p>And then Rupert came in, with Simon Foster close behind
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been at the ale-house, Simon,&#8221; said Lady Royd
shrewishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, by your leave. I&#8217;ve been on the King&#8217;s business,
and other needs must wait, my lady. So I was taught, leastways,
when I was a bairn at my father&#8217;s knee.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&#8220;What is the mystery, Rupert?&#8221; asked Nance, after Simon
had grumbled his way toward the servants&#8217; quarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mystery? None, my dear, except that I&#8217;m tired to death,
and have the round of the house to go before I get to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke the truth. Mystery there was none, except that
out of his great love for her he was learning many lessons.
And she tempted him, meanwhile, to tell her what this business
was that had taken Simon and himself to the open fields;
but he gave no answer.</p>

<p>And that evening passed, as many another had done, with
a monotony that seemed to tick the seconds out, deliberate as
the eight-day clock in the hall&mdash;a passionless, grave clock that
had seen many generations of the Royds go through their
hot youth, their fiery middle-age, their last surrender&mdash;surrender
honourable, upright, staunch in the last hour, to that
great general, Death, who has taken more citadels than any
human hero of renown.</p>

<p>The eight-day clock knew that life was not meant to be
taken at the gallop, each moment packed with ambush, high
romance, fine-spoken wooing that could not outlast the honeymoon.
It knew that fine deeds&mdash;big moments when the
heart finds room to know itself&mdash;are earned by steady preparation,
ticked out by the slow-moving seconds. But Nance
had all this to learn as yet, and this evening, of all evenings
she had spent at Windyhough, seemed the longest and the
dreariest. And my lady&#8217;s little spaniel&mdash;a nervous, unlicked
lap-dog&mdash;annoyed her beyond reason.</p>

<p>Lady Royd was full of dread and surmise. First, she
heard a mouse gnawing at the wainscoting, and fell into a
panic obviously real. Then a farm-dog began to yelp and
whimper from the stables, and she was sure it foretold disaster
to her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was so foolish of him,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to go on this wild
Rising. He had all to keep him here&mdash;his wife and his two
sons and the house he loved, and the hunting in the winter.
Why did he leave it all? He had <i>all</i> to keep him, Nance.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>Because she was tired and heart-sick, perhaps, Nance spoke
with a wisdom not her own; for at these times we do not lash
instinct to the gallop, but let it carry us like a sure-footed
horse. &#8220;Except his heart. It was his heart that took him
south.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But his heart was here, my girl,&#8221; put in the other, with
sudden spirit. She had been moved to terror by the sound
of a mouse in the wainscoting; but she was fierce in her defence
of the love her goodman bore her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Nance gently, as if she persuaded a child to
learn some obvious and simple lesson, &#8220;his heart could not be
here until he had answered the call of honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, spare me!&#8221; sighed the other languidly. &#8220;Honour is
so pretty a thing&mdash;like a rapier, or a Frenchman&#8217;s wit&mdash;when
they sing of it in ballads. But in practice it is like getting up
at sunrise to see the poet&#8217;s dawn&mdash;so chilly and uncomfortable,
Nance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else?&#8221; said Nance, her head thrown up with a sudden,
eager gesture that was vastly like her father&#8217;s. &#8220;Honour
rusts, my lady, if it stays always in the scabbard. Discomfort?
I think honour&mdash;Sir Jasper&#8217;s and my father&#8217;s&mdash;feeds
on discomfort, thrives on it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Sir Jasper, what more did he need? He can find no
more if he returns&mdash;no more than he left behind when he went
on this wild-goose chase. I shall be waiting for him&mdash;the wife
who loves him, no more, no less&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there a boundary-wall round love, then?&#8221; asked Nance,
with eyes wide open and astonished. &#8220;I&#8217;m young and fanciful,
perhaps. I thought love was a thing that found wider
fields to travel every hour; that, each day one&#8217;s man
came home with honour, one cared for him ever a little
the more, and knighted him afresh. For it is knighthood,
surely, a true man asks always from the woman of his
choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd fingered her scent-bottle, and laughed vaguely,
enjoying the girl&#8217;s transparent honesty. &#8220;It all has a romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
sound, Nance. Did you learn it from books, as poor
Rupert learned his soldiery?&#8221;</p>

<p>The taunt stung Nance, because she had hoped, with odd
persistency, that Rupert would come in, after going his round
of the house, to ask her to sing to him. And he had not come;
and she had tender songs enough in readiness, for she remembered
how wantonly she had hurt him not long ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you learn it, girl?&#8221; insisted Lady Royd, with
tired irony. &#8220;I&#8217;m past the age of glamour&mdash;and half regret
it&mdash;and you may recapture for me all the fragment silliness.
Nance, believe me, I cannot make a satisfying meal of dew-drops.
I must be getting old, for I grow fonder and fonder
of my cook, who sends substantial rations from the kitchen.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then Nance, hot-headed, resentful, not guessing that she
was being gently baited to while away an hour&#8217;s boredom from
her companion&mdash;Nance stood to her little, queenly height.
And her eyes were beautiful, because her eagerness shone
through them. And she tapped her buckled slipper on the
beeswaxed floor, as if she were impatient to be dancing with
true men, or dying with them along the road that Sir Jasper
and his friends had sought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I learned it&mdash;as Rupert learned his soldiery, I think&mdash;not
from books at all, my lady. It was my heart taught me, or
my soul, or what you choose to name that something which is&mdash;is
bigger, somehow, than one&#8217;s self. Honour&mdash;I cannot tell
you the keen, sharp strength, the sweetness and the pity the
word spells for me. It is like the swords my father is so
fond of&mdash;bright and slim, like toys to look at; but you can
bend them till point touches hilt and yet not break them. And
you can ride out and cleave a way with these same words.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd was no cynic now. The peril and discomfort
of the times had been opening closed windows for her, as
for others who lived near this wind-swept heath. By stealth,
and fearing much, she had peered out through these unshuttered
casements; and Nance was speaking outright of the
fugitive, dim thoughts that she herself had harboured.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>&#8220;Go, my dear,&#8221; she said gently. &#8220;You&#8217;ve the voice you
sing with&mdash;the voice that Rupert praises. Go, sing to me
again of&mdash;of love and honour, child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance flushed. She scarcely knew what she had said. &#8220;I
do not need,&#8221; she said, with instinctive grace and dignity.
&#8220;You know so much of them, and I so little; and I am sorry
if&mdash;if I spoke in haste. I am so tired, and I forget the&mdash;the
deference owing to your years.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then, because they stood very near each other for this
moment, and because she feared intimacy just yet with the
simple, happy glimpse of life that Nance had shown her, Sir
Jasper&#8217;s wife drew her skirts about her and picked up the
yapping, pampered thing she called a dog and kissed its nose.
It was her signal for good-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman likes deference, my dear,&#8221; she said sharply,
&#8220;deference of all kinds, except that owing to&mdash;to advancing
years. You sang out of tune there, Nance. Never to be
made love to again; never again, so long as one&#8217;s little world
lasts, to catch the glance, the little broken word of tribute&mdash;things
that do not wrong one&#8217;s husband, Nance, but add a spice
to the workaday, quiet road of love for him; they&#8217;re hard to
give up, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance looked at her with frank surprise. She was strong
and untried yet; and Lady Royd was frail, but experienced
so far as indolence allowed. And there was a deep gulf between
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take my candle up,&#8221; said Nance lamely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and sleep well, child. Dream of&mdash;oh, of love and
honour and the foolish rosemary of life. And come sing to
me to-morrow&mdash;of the things you&#8217;ve dreamed. Perhaps I
spoke at random, Nance. I&#8217;m widowed of my husband; and
this Rising never wore a lucky face to me&mdash;and&mdash;my temper
is not gentle, Nance, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night there were few who slept at Windyhough. Sir
Jasper&#8217;s wife, alone with the wind that rattled at her window,
made no disguise of the love that beat, strong and trusty, underneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
her follies. Despite herself, she had come out at
last into the road of life&mdash;the road of mire and jealousies and
tragedy, lit far ahead by the single lamp of honour, for those
whose eyes were trained to see it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worthy of him,&#8221; she moaned, drawing the sleepy
spaniel toward her. &#8220;My husband climbs the bigger hills,
while I&mdash;am weak, as Rupert is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance, too, lay awake. She was busy with what Lady Royd
had named the rosemary of life. All her instincts rose in warm
defence of that view of honour which Sir Jasper&#8217;s wife had
slighted. And there were men, men in their own midst, who
could love in the old knightly way. There was Will Underwood&mdash;and
so she lost herself, half between waking and
dreaming, in a maze of high perfection that she reared about
his person. Of a truth Wild Will was in danger, had he
known it. He had pressed his suit on Nance, had urged it,
in and out of season, during the months that preceded this upset
of the Rising. He had captured her fancy already, and her
heart might follow any day; but he did not guess what simplicity
and breadth of tenderness she would bring him, what
answering devotion she would ask. Nance had the double
gift&mdash;she had the woman&#8217;s instincts, the woman&#8217;s suppleness of
fancy, but she had been reared in a house where a big, downright
father and big, uncompromising brothers had trained her
to the man&#8217;s code of life. She would never come to the
wooing as to a one-sided bargain, giving all meekly and
asking nothing in return. She would ask, with tenderest
persistence, that her man, as she had said to Lady Royd,
should claim knighthood at her hands once every while.
Marriage, to her unproved heart, was a thing magical, renewing
its romance each day&mdash;but renewing, too, that every-day
and hard endeavour on which the true romance is founded.</p>

<p>And so she got to sleep at last, and woke in terror. She
had dreamed that Will Underwood, engaged in a single-handed
fight against a company of the Prince&#8217;s enemies, lay
wounded sorely; and she had reached out hands, impotent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
with nightmare, to succour him, and she had seen him fall.</p>

<p>At the end of the long, draughty corridor, not many yards
away from her, Rupert was fighting his new trouble. He and
Simon had been engaged on the King&#8217;s business&mdash;or the pretence
of it&mdash;during these excursions that had taken them
afield for two days past. But he could only remember now
what had driven him into endeavour&mdash;how he had come home
to find Nance flushed and eager, Simon carrying a couple
of muskets; and how she had told him, in plain words, that
women must needs take up soldiery, because the men about
the house were so infirm.</p>

<p>Since his soul was launched into the open sea of life, Rupert
had known many a Gethsemane, but the pain had never
been so keen as now. His love for Nance was of the kind she
claimed, but his power to do high deeds lagged far behind
the will to be a conqueror. And Nance, who had always
brought a sense of well-being and of inspiration to him, had
wounded him&mdash;mortally, he thought. Sir Jasper had bidden
him guard the house, and he had overheard his father say
that the defence was a toy he left his heir to play with; and
the bitterness of that was past, not without hardship and a
struggle that, fought out in loneliness, was fine as a battle
against heavy odds. That was past, but Nance&#8217;s taunt was
with him still, a sting that banished sleep and poisoned all
his outlook on the hills where Faith, crowned and a strong
monarch, looks down to see into the hearts of men and
choose her soldiers.</p>

<p>Old Simon Foster, for his part, had not slept well to-night.
As he put it to himself, he &#8220;was never one to miss sleep or
victuals, come peace or earthquakes&#8221;; but to-night he could
not rest. He was with the master, fighting somewhere near
to that London which was a far-off land to him, unknown
and perilous, as if wide seas divided it from Lancashire. And
he was itching to be out of a house where the mistress could
still be anxious lest her spaniel missed his proper meals,
where, to his fancy, women crowded all the passages and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
hindered him at every turn. Simon was twisted out of shape
by exposure and harsh, rheumatic pains, but he was sick to
be out again with the wind and the weather that had crippled
him.</p>

<p>Simon Foster, too infirm to go with his master to the
wars, was ill-tempered these days, as a grey old hound is
when he sees the whelps of his own fathering go out to
hunting while he is left at home. He was in and out of the
house, till the women-servants grew tired of his grim,
weather-beaten face. Only Martha put in a good word for
him&mdash;Martha who, at five-and-thirty, had not found a mate,
though she would have made a good wife to any man. Simon
was barely turned fifty, she said, and was hale enough &#8220;if
rheumatiz would only let him bide in peace.&#8221; And when a
prim maid-of-all-work had suggested that bent legs tempted
no maid&#8217;s fancy, Martha had answered hotly that the shape
of a man&#8217;s heart mattered more than any casual infirmity
attaching to his legs.</p>

<p>He got up this morning, two hours before the wintry
dawn came red and buoyant over Pendle Hill, for he could
not rest indoors. He went to the stables, his lantern swinging
crazily in his gnarled hands, and roused the horses from
the slumber that is never sleep, because men ask so much
of them at all hours of the day and night, and patted them, as
a father touches his bairns&mdash;gently, with a sort of benediction.
For the smell of a horse to Simon was vastly comforting.</p>

<p>He came to an old, fiddle-headed nag that had been a pensioner
at Windyhough these many years, and stayed and
chatted with him with the ease that comes of long comradeship.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in the same plight, lad,&#8221; he growled&mdash;&#8220;old, and
left at home, the two of us. Ay, we&#8217;re thrown on the lumber-heap,
I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went out by and by; and his face cleared suddenly like
wintry sunlight creeping over a grey stubble-field, as he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Martha cross from the mistals with a milking-pail over each
well-rounded arm. And, because there seemed little else to
to, he stopped to praise the trim shape of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;And your cheeks, Martha,&#8221; he added, after a pause&mdash;&#8220;there&#8217;s
some warm wind been at &#8217;em, or they&#8217;d never look
so bonnie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Winds blow cold up hereabout,&#8221; said Martha demurely,
setting down her pails. &#8220;And my cheeks are my own, Simon
Foster, by your leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simon had known this game of give-and-take with a lass
in the days before he grew harder and more keen on battle.
He returned now with ease to habits forsworn until the
Rising left him derelict among the women.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, but they&#8217;re not, as the bee said to the clover.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For shame, Simon&mdash;and at your age, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At my age! I&#8217;d teach ye I&#8217;m young if rheumatiz was
not like a hive o&#8217; bees about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She twisted a corner of her apron, half hid her face with
it; and Simon admitted to himself that the brown eyes looking
into his &#8220;might be tempting, like, to a younger lad than me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At my age a man&#8217;s just beginning to know women,&#8221; he
said persuasively. &#8220;It takes a long &#8217;prenticeship, Martha.
You can learn to break in a horse, or do smithy work, or
aught useful like, in a lile few years. But to learn the way
of a woman&mdash;durned if it isn&#8217;t a long job and a tough job,
Martha.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very simple, if you men weren&#8217;t blind as bats at
midday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ay; you&#8217;re simple!&#8221; put in Simon, with a quiet
chuckle. &#8220;Simple as driving sows to market.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then Martha put a hand to each of her milking-pails.
&#8220;I&#8217;d best be getting on with my work. If you&#8217;re likening
me to a sow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there! It wasn&#8217;t you lass; it was women not
just so bonnie&mdash;the most part o&#8217; women, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martha lingered. The deft flattery had pleased her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
she was willing to surrender any casual defence of her own
sex. &#8220;Well, the most part o&#8217; women, Simon, they&#8217;re feather-witted
maybe. I&#8217;ll own as much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And like sows,&#8221; went on the other, with patient explanation
of his theme. &#8220;A man chooses his straight road and
sticks to it, but a sow, when you want to get her Lunnon
way, why, you&#8217;ve just to twist her by the tail, backward foremost,
and pretend you want her to head straight for Scotland.&#8221;</p>

<p>They eyed each other with a large, impassive silence.
There was plenty of leisure these days at Windyhough, too
much of it; and Simon found it pleasant to watch Martha&#8217;s
wholesome, wind-sweet face, to hear the voice that seemed
made for singing to the kine while she sat at the milking-pail.
And Martha, for her part, had never known a wooing,
and the prime hunger of her life still went unsatisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Human nature&mdash;it&#8217;s a queer matter,&#8221; said Simon by and
by.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s a deal of it about,&#8221; sighed Martha. &#8220;Human
nature&mdash;soon as ever a body can get away from moil
and toil and begin to think, like&mdash;why, it&#8217;s just made up o&#8217;
things we haven&#8217;t got, Simon. And if we&#8217;d got them we
shouldn&#8217;t care so much for &#8217;em, and so it&#8217;s all a round o&#8217;
foolishness, like a donkey treading at the mill-wheel.&#8221;</p>

<p>A tear fell down on to Martha&#8217;s hand, and, because the
grief was come by honestly, Simon felt an odd impulse stirring
him. &#8220;Martha, my lass, I wish I was a good twenty years
younger. If I were forty, now, and you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m nearing forty, Simon. We&#8217;ll not talk of ages, by
your leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simon walked up and down the yard, in a mood that was
half between panic and something worthier. Then he came
to Martha&#8217;s side. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a mind to kiss you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m busy,&#8221; said Martha; &#8220;but I might happen spare
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so they plighted troth. And Simon, when at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
he went indoors to get about the duties Lady Royd found for
him, was astonished that he had no qualms. He had given
his promise, and knew that, as a man of his word, he would
keep it. All old instincts whispered that he had been &#8220;varry
rash to tie himself in a halter in that fool&#8217;s fashion&#8221;; and yet
he felt only like a lad who goes whistling to help his lass
bring in the kine to byre.</p>

<p>As he reached the house, Nance, in her riding-habit,
stepped out into the courtyard. Tired of her restless dreams,
weary to death of the inaction and misery at Windyhough,
she had stolen out of the house like a thief, afraid lest Lady
Royd should need her before she made good her escape. She
flushed guiltily even at this meeting with Simon, as if he had
detected her in wrong-doing, though her longing for a gallop
was innocent enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re for riding on horseback, Miss Nance?&#8221; he asked,
by way of giving her good-day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Simon. I shall die if I spend another day indoors.
It is like being wrapped in cotton-wool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, you&#8217;re right! I&#8217;ve just been to the stables
myself,&#8221; he added dryly, &#8220;and you&#8217;ve the pick of three rare
stay-at-homes to choose from. One&#8217;s broken-winded, and
one&#8217;s spavined, and t&#8217;other&#8217;s lame in the off hind-leg.
There&#8217;s a fine choice for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which of the three shall I choose?&#8221; laughed Nance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d take the broken-winded one, with the head like
Timothy Wade&#8217;s bass-viol that he plays i&#8217; church. He&#8217;s a lot
o&#8217; fire in him yet&mdash;if you don&#8217;t mind him roaring like a
half-gale under you. I was talking to him just now&mdash;telling
him the oldsters had as much pluck in &#8217;em as the youngsters.
It was a shame, I said, to leave such spirited folk as him and
me behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance gave him a friendly smile&mdash;he had always been a
favourite of hers, by force of his tough, homespun strength
and honesty&mdash;and crossed the yard. The stablemen and
grooms were off with Sir Jasper to the wars&mdash;all save two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
who were past seventy, and were warming themselves indoors
before facing the nipping wind. She found the three
horses left, like the stablemen, because of age and infirmity,
and helped Simon, with a quickness she had learned in childhood,
to saddle the fiddle-headed beast that he had recommended.</p>

<p>The beast had been eating his head off, and was almost
youthful in caprice and eagerness as Nance rode him up
into the moors. He had watched his comrades go out a
week ago&mdash;mettled youngsters, neighing with wide nostrils
from sheer lust of adventure&mdash;and he had been left to
eat more corn than was good for him, left to think back along
the years when men had needed him to carry the burden of
their hopes.</p>

<p>The horse knew, perhaps, that Nance, like himself, was
seeking respite from indolence and the companionship of
ailing folk. He carried her bravely, and disguised from her
for a while, with a certain chivalry, the fact that he was
broken-winded. When they came to the moor, however, the
smell of the marshes and the ling seemed to get to his head,
like too much wine; and twice he all but unseated Nance, who
was thinking of Will Underwood, riding south like her
father into that perilous country where George the Second
was seated on a stolen throne.</p>

<p>The horse, after his display of youthfulness, was content
to laze up and down the sheep-tracks of the heath; and even
Nance, blind as she was by habit to the failings of her comrades,
was aware that he was roaring now like a half-gale
from the north.</p>

<p>Then she forgot the horse, forgot the languid mother, the
weakling heir, down yonder at the bleak house of Windyhough.
Her thoughts returned to her father, to Sir Jasper,
to gentle and simple of the Lancashire men who had ridden
out against long odds. Last of all, her maidenly reserve
broke down, and she knew that she was eager for Will Underwood&#8217;s
safety. She saw him so clearly&mdash;fearless, a keen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
rider after hounds, a man who sought danger and coveted
it. Surely he was made for such reckless battles as were
coming. Through her anxieties, through her womanish picturing
of the wounds and sickness that were lying in wait
along this high-road that led south to victory and the Stuart,
she was glad that &#8220;Wild Will&#8221; would need her prayers, her
trust in him.</p>

<p>She rode slowly up by way of Hangman&#8217;s Snout&mdash;a bluff,
round hill that once had carried a gallows-tree. Line by
swarthy line the heath widened out before her as she climbed.
Crumpled hillocks, flat wastes of peat, acre after acre of dead
bracken intermixed with ling and benty grasses, swept out
and up to the sky that was big with sunrise and with storm.
The wind blew cold and shrill, and all was empty loneliness;
but to Nance it seemed that she was in a friendly land, where
she was free to breathe. They would not let her fight for
the true cause; she had no skill in arms; but here, on the
naked, friendly heath, she was free at least to grasp the meaning
of that stormy hardship which her folk had been content
to undergo.</p>

<p>There was Sir Jasper&mdash;her father, and many who had
ridden out from the Loyal Meet at Windyhough under her
own eyes&mdash;and all of them had seemed instinct with this
large, stormy air that lay above the moors. She was girlish
yet, healthy and in need of pleasure; and she had wondered,
seeing these men ride from Windyhough, that they were so
grave about the matter, intent and quiet, as if they went to
kirk instead of to the wars. Like Rupert, she had pictured
the scene in more vivid colours, had been impatient that no
music of the pipes, no rousing cheers had gone to the farewell.
She had longed for the strong lights and shades of
drama, and had found instead a workaday company of gentlemen
who rode about their business and made no boast of it.</p>

<p>Here on the wintry heights she looked life in the face to-day.
These men who had ridden out&mdash;Sir Jasper turning
only at the last moment to kiss his wife, though he was deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in love with her at the end of many years&mdash;had been rugged
and silent as the hills that had nursed their strength and
loyalty.</p>

<p>Nance was not herself just now. The superstitious would
have said that she was &#8220;seeing far.&#8221; And so she was&mdash;far
as the red sunrise-glow that reached up to heaven. She and
the moors, between them, struck sparks of vivid faith from
the winter&#8217;s barrenness and hardship. She was sure that
summer would return, fragrant with the scent of Stuart
roses.</p>

<p>They had reached the top of Hangman&#8217;s Snout, she and
her broken-winded horse. And suddenly a doubt came
blowing down the breeze to her. Will Underwood had been
absent from the Loyal Meet. She was aware that men
doubted him in some subtle manner that did not need words
to explain its meaning. He was popular, in a haphazard
way, with his own kind; but always, as Nance looked back
along the years, there was a suggestion that he was happier
among the women, because he had the gift of fooling them.
And yet men admitted that he was a good companion in all
field-sports&mdash;and yet again Nance remembered how, not long
ago, she had overheard her father talking with Oliphant of
Muirhouse, when they did not guess that she was within
earshot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will Underwood will join us,&#8221; Squire Roger had said,
with the testiness of a man who only half believes his own
words. &#8220;He takes any fence that comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Oliphant had broken in, with the dry smile of one
who knew his world. &#8220;Yes, he can gallop well. Can he
stand a siege, though?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A siege?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not always a game fox in front, Squire&mdash;and
hounds running with a fine, full-throated cry. I&#8217;m on the
other side o&#8217; life myself&mdash;the long night rides, when a man
would barter all for one clean fight in open daylight. Underwood
will not find this march such a gallop. Horse and foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
go together, and the roads are vile. Can he last, Squire,
crawling at a foot pace?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance remembered the very tone of Oliphant&#8217;s voice&mdash;the
dry, sharp challenge in it, as of one who had learned to sum
up a man&#8217;s character quickly. It was her own judgment of
Will Underwood, though warm liking for him&mdash;his bigness
and his way of taking fences&mdash;had stifled half her healthy
common sense.</p>

<p>She checked her horse, looked out across this land of wintry
nakedness. It was here on the uplands that she had let
Underwood steal into her friendship, here that her quick
need for romance had shaped him to the likeness of a gentleman&mdash;gallant,
debonair, a man to count on whether peace or
war were in the doing.</p>

<p>Something of the wind&#8217;s free-roving heedlessness took hold
of her. She was free to choose her man, free to be loyal to
her heart and let her judgment go.</p>

<p>She looked down the slope. A horseman came suddenly
into view, riding up the trough of the hills. She checked her
horse, with a sharp, instinctive cry. The superstitions of the
moor, bred in its lonely marshes and voiced by its high priests,
the curlews and the plover, crept round her like the hill-mists
that bewilder human judgment. Will Underwood was
away with the Stuart, riding south to London and the Restoration;
yet he was coming up to meet her, over the slopes
which they had crossed together on many a hunting-day.</p>

<p>She watched him climb the slope. There was no mistaking
the dashing, handsome figure, the way he had of sitting
a horse; and the wide emptiness of the heath, its savage loneliness,
seemed only to make bigger this intruder who rode up
into its silence.</p>

<p>The old, unconquerable legends of the moor returned to
Nance. Her nurse had taught her, long ago, what such
apparitions meant. The dead were allowed to return to those
they loved, for the brief hour before the soul, half between
heaven and earth, took its last departure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>She watched the horseman ride nearer, nearer. And suddenly
she broke into a flood of tears. He had died in battle&mdash;had
died for the Stuart&mdash;and was riding up, a ghostly horseman
on a phantom steed, to tell her of it. He had died well&mdash;yes&mdash;but
she would miss him in the coming years. She
would miss him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Again she thought of Rupert. All his life the Scholar
had been struggling against impotence and misery. He had
grown used to it by habit; and, of all her friends, she longed
most to have him by her side, because he would understand this
trouble that unsteadied her.</p>

<p>Will Underwood&#8217;s wraith came up and up the track. She
drooped in the saddle of the broken-winded horse, and hid her
eyes, and waited for the kiss, cold as an east wind over the
marshes, that would tell her he was loyal in the dying. The
tales of nursery days were very close about her now, and she
was a child who walked in the unknown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Nance, what the devil is amiss? You&#8217;re crying like
a burn in spate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will&#8217;s voice was sharp and human. Nance reined back a
pace or two. They were so near, so big, Will and his horse,
that they shattered her nursery tales with bewildering roughness.</p>

<p>For a while she could not speak, could not check the sobs
which were a tribute, not to the living man but to his wraith.
Then she gathered up her strength, for she came of a plucky
stock. Will Underwood was good at reading women&#8217;s
faces; it was his trade in life; but he could make nothing of
Nance just now. Her glance was searching, her eyes quiet
and hard, though tears were lying on her lashes still. All
her world had slipped from under her. There seemed no
longer any trust, or faith, or happiness in the bleak years to
come; but at least she had her pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nance, what is it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you a ghost just now, Mr. Underwood&mdash;the
ghost of your better self, may be. And now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>&#8220;Well, and now?&#8221; he broke in, with the hardy self-assurance
that had served him well in days gone by. &#8220;I&#8217;m alive,
and entirely at your service, Nance. Surely there&#8217;s no occasion
for distress in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked gravely at him for a moment, with clear eyes
that seemed to glance through and beyond him, as if his handsome
body and his strength had disappeared, leaving only a
puff of unsubstantial wind behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;There <i>is</i> occasion,&#8221; she said, very gravely and in a voice
that was musical with pain and steadfastness. &#8220;You had
better be lying dead, Mr. Underwood, along some road of
loyalty, than&mdash;than be idling here, when other men are fighting.&#8221;</p>

<p>He reddened, seemed at a loss for words. Then, &#8220;Nance,
what a child you are&mdash;and I fancied you a woman grown,&#8221;
he said, with an attempt at playfulness. &#8220;What is this Rising,
after all? A few Scots ragamuffins following a laddie
with yellow hair and flyaway wits. Let the women sing ballads,
and dream dreams; but level-headed men don&#8217;t risk all
on moonshine of that sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father&mdash;he is older than you, and is counted&mdash;more
level-headed, shall we say? Sir Jasper Royd, too, is a soldier
whose record all men know. <i>They</i> have gone with the ragamuffins
and the yellow-haired laddie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Underwood was startled by the quiet irony, the security, that
were instinct in the girl&#8217;s voice, her bearing. She was not
the wayward, pleasure-loving Nance he had known; she stood,
in some odd way, for all the pride and all the resolution of
her race. He had earned his title of &#8220;Wild Will&#8221; by taking
fences which men more sensitively built refused to hazard,
and by more doubtful exploits which were laughed at and
avoided by the cleaner sort among his comrades. He was
good to look at, gay and dominant; yet never, to his life&#8217;s
end, would he lay hold of the subtle meaning which those
of an old race attach to that one word &#8220;loyalty.&#8221; It was not
his fault that his father had been of slight account, except for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a gift of money-making; but he had not cared to learn the
lessons which the second generation must, if it wished to lay
hold of old tradition and make itself a home among the great-hearted,
simple gentlemen of Lancashire.</p>

<p>He and Nance were alone here on the uplands. A ragged,
crimson sunset lingered over the moor. A cock-grouse got
up from the heather on their right, and whirred down the
bitter wind, chuckling harshly as it went. It was a man&#8217;s
land, this, full of hills that stepped, sleety and austere, to the
red of the stormy sky. A man should have been easily the
master here; and yet Underwood knew that he was dwarfed,
belittled, by this slim lass of Demaine&#8217;s, whose eyes held truth
and looked him through and through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your excuse, Mr. Underwood?&#8221; asked Nance, in a tone
as wintry as the hills.</p>

<p>He should have known, from the quiet and hungry longing
in her face, from the shiver that took her unawares,
though the wind&#8217;s cold had no part in it, how eagerly she
waited for his answer. He had shared her dreams. He had
captured a liking that was very near to love; and she was
defending the last ditch of her faith in him. If he could
make amends, even now&mdash;and surely he must, he who was so
big and strong&mdash;if he could give her one sudden, inspired
word that would unravel all the tangle&mdash;she was ready to
believe in him.</p>

<p>Instead, Will laughed like a country hobbledehoy. &#8220;My
excuse&mdash;why, prudence, Nance; and prudence, they say, is a
quiet mare to ride or drive at all times. I&#8217;ll join your Rising
when there&#8217;s a better chance of its success. There were few
rode out from Lancashire, after all; I&#8217;ve met many a stay-at-home
good fellow already since I returned from the business
that took me south.&#8221;</p>

<p>He regretted the words as soon as they were spoken.
Her tone, her contemptuous air of question, had stung him.
Until now he had assumed the manners worn by these people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
into whose midst his father had intruded, had carried lip-service
to the Stuart passably enough, had won his way by
conformity to the letter of their deep traditions. And here
and now, on the moor that would have none of lies, he had
plucked the mask aside, so that Nance shrank back a little in
the saddle, afraid of the meanness in his face.</p>

<p>There was a silence, broken only by the wind&#8217;s fret, by the
ripple of a neighbouring stream whose floods were racing
banktop high. With sharp insistence, one memory came to
Nance. She recalled how, weeks ago, she had left Rupert
and his brother to their fight, had ridden down to Demaine
House with Will, had found her father eager as a boy because
Oliphant of Muirhouse had brought news of the Rising.
She recalled, too, how Underwood had seemed cold, how he
had followed her out into the hall and answered her distrust
of him. And she had listened to his pleading&mdash;had bidden
him come before the month was out, if he were leal&mdash;<i>if he
were leal</i>.</p>

<p>The moor, and the frost that made rose-pink and amber of
the sunset sky, were very cold to Nance just now. If she
had felt distrust of this big, loose-built ruffler, she had been
willing enough to let first love cover up her doubts. She had
cared for what he might have been, and had been concerned
each day to hide the traces of what, in sober fact, he was.
For a moment it seemed to her that pride, and strength, and
all, had left her. It was hard and bitter to know that something
warmer, gayer than she had known as yet, had gone
from her, not to return.</p>

<p>Then courage came to her again, borrowed from the hard-riding
days that had fathered many generations of her race.
&#8220;Mr. Underwood,&#8221; she said, not looking at him, &#8220;you picked
up my kerchief not long ago&mdash;do you remember?&mdash;and asked
to keep it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even now he could not rid himself of the easy hunting
days, the easy conquests, which had built up a wall of self-security<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
about him. &#8220;You&#8217;ll give it me before the month
is out, Nance? You promised it,&#8221; he said, edging his horse
nearer hers.</p>

<p>Nance took a kerchief from the pocket of her riding-coat.
&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I keep my word. You may claim it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took it, put it to his lips, all with the over-done effrontery
of a groom who finds the master&#8217;s daughter stooping
to him. &#8220;I shall keep it,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;until the next true
Rising comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Nance submissively. &#8220;You may keep it, Mr.
Underwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, call me Will!&#8221; he blundered on. &#8220;Listen, Nance.
When I spoke of prudence just now, I&mdash;I lied. You stung
me into saying what I did not mean. There were reasons
kept me here. You&#8217;ll believe me, surely? Urgent reasons.
And here I am, eating my heart out while other men are taking
happy risks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance glanced once at him. His voice was persuasive as of
old; he had the same easy seat in saddle, the handsome, dash-away
figure that had given him a certain romantic place of
his own among his intimates; but there was something new.
She understood, with sudden humiliation and self-pity, how
slight a thing first love may be. And, because he had forced
this knowledge on her, she would not spare him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may keep it,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;The enemy may
come to Windyhough, and you will need a flag of truce, as
the old men and the disabled will&mdash;and my kerchief&mdash;it will
serve as well as another.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was alone with him, here on the empty moor, and had
only a broken-winded horse to help her if need asked. Yet
her disdain of him was so complete, her humiliation so bitter,
that she had no fear. She spoke slowly, quietly; and Underwood
reined his horse back a little, as if she had struck him
with her riding-whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this because I&#8217;ll not risk my head for a wild-cat plot
to put a Stuart on the throne?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, not for that reason. Because you promised to risk
your head; because, in time of peace, you persuaded loyal
gentlemen that you were one of them; because, Mr. Underwood,
you ran away before you had ever seen the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance&#8217;s one desire was to hurt this man, to get through
his armour of good living and complacency; it was her way&mdash;the
woman&#8217;s way&mdash;of digging a grave in which to hide the
first love that was dead, unlovely, pitiful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we hunted yesterday,&#8221; said the other doggedly.
&#8220;There were plenty of Lancashire gentlemen in my own case&mdash;our
heads sounder than our hearts&mdash;and we had fine sport.
And, coming home&mdash;you&#8217;ll forgive me&mdash;we laughed at Sir
Jasper and his handful of enthusiasts. We like them&mdash;we
shall miss them when they&#8217;re gibbeted in London&mdash;but we
laughed at their old-fashioned view of honour. Honour trims
pretty rosettes for a man to wear, but doesn&#8217;t save his head.
Honour&#8217;s a woman&#8217;s pastime, Miss Demaine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance looked at him with frank astonishment. This man
knew that her own father was of Sir Jasper&#8217;s company, that
she was troubled, like all stay-at-homes, lest ill news should
come. And he chose this time to defend himself by confessing
that he and others had laughed at better men. And he
talked of Tower Hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the gentlemen of Lancashire return&mdash;when the
Prince has come to his own, and England is free again and
happy&mdash;what then, Mr. Underwood? It will go ill, I think,
with masqueraders.&#8221;</p>

<p>They faced each other, the man insolent, ungroomed&mdash;true
to his breed, as folk are apt to be in time of stress&mdash;Nance
in that mood of hot fury and contempt which is cool and
debonair.</p>

<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221; he said, stroking his horse&#8217;s neck. &#8220;The
Vicar of Bray was a very good man of the world, after all,
and he prospered. We shall toast the Stuart openly; it will
save all that clumsy ritual of passing the wine across the
water.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>Nance was healthy, eager, human. She shrank, with an
odd, childish loathing, from this man who counted the world&mdash;the
big, gallant world of faith, and strife, and loyalty&mdash;as
a dining-table, no more, no less, where wise men took their
ease. She gathered the reins into her hand, turned in saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep the kerchief, sir,&#8221; she said gently. &#8220;As I told you,
you will need it when&#8221;&mdash;her voice broke suddenly, against
her will&mdash;&#8220;when our men come home from the crowning.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then she left him. He watched her go down the slope
on her fiddle-headed nag. All his buoyancy was gone. He
had been spoiled by flattery, of word and glance; he had been
accustomed to be taken at his surface value, giving his friends
little opportunity to test whether he rang true or not. And
now he was like a pampered child that meets its first rebuff.
His pluck had left him. He had no heart to follow Nance,
though by and by he would regret the lost opportunity to
claim rough satisfaction for her handling of him. She had
spoken, with such security and pride, of the loyalty that was
an instinct with her. Her men who had ridden out were of
the like mind; and Underwood, in a flash of enlightenment
and dismay, saw how the coming days would go with him if
this haphazard venture of the Prince&#8217;s carried him to London
and the throne. His comfortable house of Underwood, his
easy life, the dinners and the hunting and the balls&mdash;all
would have to be given up. He had no illusions now as to
his power to continue here among them, explaining his share
in the enterprise, winning his way back to favour by excellence
in field-sports and in ladies&#8217; parlours. If the Prince
came to his own, there would be an end of Wild Will, so
far as loyal Lancashire was concerned; for at every turn he
would have to meet the scorn that Nance had given him so
unsparingly to-day.</p>

<p>Nance looked back once, when she was half down the
slope, and saw him sitting rigid in the saddle, horse and
man showing in clear, lonely outline against the rainy sky.
He would be himself again to-morrow, for shallowness can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
never suffer long; but she would have pitied him, may be,
could she have guessed his bitter loneliness just now. Shorn
of his self-love, Nance lost beyond hope of regaining&mdash;instinct
told him so much&mdash;alive to the cowardice which no
longer wore the more pleasant air of prudence, Underwood
looked out on lands as forlorn as himself; and, far down the
slope, he saw Nance&#8217;s little figure, and knew that, in some
odd way that was better than himself, he loved this trim lass
of Demaine&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Nance reached the lower lands, where the bridle-track ran
in and out beside the swollen streams, past coppices where the
trees were comely in their winter&#8217;s nakedness. She saw each
line and furrow of the pastures, remembered they had found
a fox last month in the spinney yonder, recalled how she and
Rupert had fished the brook together, just where it ran under
the grey stone bridge below her. All her faculties seemed
to be sharpened, rather than deadened, by the blow, pitiless
and hard, that Will had given her just now. Her first
love&mdash;the delicate and fragrant thing that had been interwoven
with her waking and her dreaming hours&mdash;had died
shamefully. She could not even bring a decent show of grief
to the graveside; her only feeling was that it should be buried,
in the middle of a dark midwinter&#8217;s night, out of all men&#8217;s
sight and gossip.</p>

<p>And, in this hour of swift and unexpected trouble, she was
as her father and her brothers would have had her be&mdash;unflinching,
reliant, reaching out instinctively to the strong morrow,
not to the dead, unlovely yesterday. Only, she was
very tired; and there was one friend she needed&mdash;a friend
who could not come and put warm, human arms about her,
because her mother had died long ago, leaving her to the
care of men who love and honour and defend their women,
but who are weak to understand their times of loneliness.</p>

<p>She was a great figure, after all, this daughter of Demaine&#8217;s
who rode on a broken-winded horse through the fieldways that
had bred her. It is easy to ride forward, head erect, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the city you have taken by assault; but it is hard to carry
upright shoulders and a firm, disdainful head, when only
faith and the clean years behind support you in the thick of
grave disaster.</p>

<p>At the bend of the track, where it passed Sunderland&#8217;s
cornmill&mdash;the water-wheel treading its sleepy round&mdash;she saw
Rupert and Simon Foster twenty yards ahead. Simon was
carrying a couple of muskets, his pockets bulging with powder-flasks
and lead, and Rupert was limping a little, as if
he had given too much work to his damaged ankle; and Nance
Demaine, who was in the mood that sees all and understands,
knew, from the look of Rupert&#8217;s back, that he was pleased
with the day&#8217;s adventure.</p>

<p>Her horse was tired now, and for the last mile she had
ridden him at a gentle foot pace. The track was heavy with
wet leaves that waited for a drying wind to scatter them.
The two on foot did not hear the muffled splash of hoofs,
and she was content to follow them.</p>

<p>She had been friendless; and now half her loneliness had
slipped away from her, at sight of Rupert limping on ahead.
He was more diffident than she, more sensitive to ridicule
and hardship; but he stood for the truths that matter in a
world where men and women are ready, for the most part,
to believe that all ends when death robs them of the power to
eat, and sleep, and dance foolishly from day to day, like
gnats when the sun is warm about them. He stood for her
own simple, downright view of creed and honour; he was a
comrade of the true breed, in brief, and she was in sore need
of companionship just now.</p>

<p>How well she seemed to know this cripple who jogged on
before her! Half-forgotten words of his; little, unselfish
surrenders when Maurice had shown a younger brother&#8217;s
wilfulness; the patient chivalry that had bidden him show
deference to Lady Royd when her tongue was lashing his infirmities&mdash;all
these stood out with startling clearness. And
again that curious, sharp pain was at her heart, and the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
thought returned how good a knight was lost to Prince
Charles Edward.</p>

<p>They were near the gate of Windyhough now, and Rupert,
hearing hoofs behind him at last, turned quickly. The familiar
eagerness came to his face at sight of her&mdash;the instant
pleasure, followed by a hint of pain; the homage that was
there to be read plainly by any onlooker.</p>

<p>&#8220;So this is the King&#8217;s business you have been about?&#8221; said
Nance, looking down at him with a tenderness that set his
blood on fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes. I said there was no mystery about it. Since
you told me you could not trust your men to shoot
straight&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Rupert, I was foolish; I did not mean it. I was out
of heart that day, and temper got the better of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was true. I had fancied that, if the attack came,
it would be enough to fire one&#8217;s musket and trust to Providence
for marksmanship. It was a daft thought, Nance, was
it not? It was shirking trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance got down from the saddle, gave the reins to Simon
Foster. &#8220;Take him to the stable, Simon,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He
has carried me well, and deserves a double feed.&#8221; She
wished to be alone with Rupert and the other&#8217;s presence
seemed an irritating check on speech. And yet, when Simon
had left them, they stood looking at each other in troubled
silence. Each was in a tense, restless mood, and their trouble
only gathered weight by the companionship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find it hard&mdash;this learning how to shoot?&#8221; she
asked at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was easier than knowing you could not trust me, Nance,
to guard you.&#8221; The old, whimsical self-derision was in his
voice. He had learned at least to carry his hurts bravely.</p>

<p>And she could find no words. There was some quality in
Rupert&mdash;of manliness&mdash;that touched her now with an emotion
deep and poignant, and clean as tempered steel.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pity of it!&#8221; she murmured, after another long, uneasy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
silence. &#8220;To prepare so well for an attack that cannot
come&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it may come, Nance. These last days&mdash;I cannot
tell you why&mdash;I have not felt that all was make-believe, as I
did at first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should it come, Rupert? They are so far away&mdash;near
London, surely, now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How will it come? I do not know. But I know that
I have asked for it&mdash;asked patiently, Nance&mdash;and faith must
be answered one day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you are so&mdash;so oddly staunch, and
so unpractical.&#8221; And her voice broke, and she could get
no farther.</p>

<p>And Rupert smiled gravely, touched her hand, as a courtier
might, and limped up toward the house.</p>

<p>Nance stood there awhile, with long thoughts for company.
Then, seeking a respite from her mood, she crossed
the stables to give a carrot to the fiddle-headed horse; but
she got no farther than the corner of the yard. At the stable-door,
deaf to all sounds from the outward world and careless
of the many windows looking out on them, Simon Foster and
Martha were standing hand in hand. Martha&#8217;s face was
rose-red and smiling, her lover&#8217;s full of an amazing foolishness.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the bonnie, snod lass you are, Martha!&#8221; Simon
was declaring. &#8220;I never thought to see such a day as this.
Why didn&#8217;t I think of it before, like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you were blind, Simon,&#8221; put in the other, with
a coy upward glance.</p>

<p>Nance retreated out of eye-shot, and for the moment she
forgot her troubles. She just laughed until her eyes were
wet and her slim little body shook. The scene was so unexpected,
so instinct with sheer humour, that the gravest must
have yielded to it. Then, as the pressure of the last ill-fated
days returned to her, she was filled with a childish wonder
that life should be so muddled, so rough-and-tumble, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
seemingly disordered. There was Sir Jasper, conquering or
defeated, but either way carrying his life in his hands. There
was Windyhough itself&mdash;house, lands and all&mdash;at stake. And
yet Simon and the dairymaid, whose discretion now, if ever,
should have ripened, were reading folly in each other&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>She heard Martha cross, singing, to the kitchen, and turned
and sought the stables again. She was anxious to learn something
which only Simon could tell her; for Rupert was diffident
of his own skill at all times, and would not have given
her, had she asked it, a true account of his marksmanship.</p>

<p>Simon was brushing down the horse when she went in.
He glanced up with grave, stolid innocence, as if he had had
no other occupation than this of grooming.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has the master learned in these last days?&#8221; she
asked abruptly. &#8220;Does he aim well, Simon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He shapes grandly; but then, he always does when his
mind is fair set on a matter. We were in a lonely spot, too,
you see, with none to laugh at him while he made his first
mistakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance stroked the fiddle-headed nag, and watched him
munch his carrot, and seemed glad to linger here.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can hit his man now, you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I reckon if I were the man, I&#8217;d as lief be out of
range as in. I tell you, the young master does naught by
halves. The trouble is to get him started. You&#8217;d best come
with us when we go out again this afternoon, and shoot a
match with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And by and by Nance went indoors with a light step and
a sense of betterment. It was pleasant to hear Rupert
praised.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>HOW THE PIPES PLAYED DREARILY</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the Lancashire farmers were watering their cattle,
milking them, tending the sheep whose fleeces were the great
part of their livelihood; while Lady Royd and Nance were
querulous because they had a roof above their heads, and fires
in the house, and food in plenty; while Rupert went doggedly
about his drill of musket-practice, with a heart yearning
for the battles he pictured in the doing London way, the
Prince&#8217;s army came to Derby&mdash;came in the dusk of a wild
November day, with wind-driven rain across their faces, and
every house-roof running wet.</p>

<p>Derby was no fine town to see. It was commonplace and
dull, to the verge of dreariness. But, to those who marched
into it to-day on the Stuart&#8217;s business, it stood ever afterwards
for a place of tragedy&mdash;tragedy so poignant and so
swift that it gathered round its mean, ill-ordered streets a
glamour not its own&mdash;the glamour of the might-have-been.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper Royd, neither then nor afterwards, could piece
together the tumult and unrest that troubled those two days
they spent at Derby. He knew that Lord Murray was
querulous, his temper shrewish; he saw the Prince move
abroad with unconquerable courage, but with the look in
his eyes that Skye men have when the sad mists hide the sun
from them. He was aware that some big issue, known only
to the leaders, was calling for prompt decision. For the
rest, he wondered that loyal gentlemen had any thought but
one&mdash;to march on where Prince Charles Edward chose to
lead.</p>

<p>Once&mdash;it was on the second morning of their halt at Derby&mdash;he
met Lord Murray face to face in the street.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>&#8220;You look trim and happy, Sir Jasper,&#8221; said Murray, uneasy
in his greeting since the duel he had fought with this
odd gentleman from Lancashire.</p>

<p>&#8220;My faith commands it. I obey. What else?&#8221; growled
the older man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re lucky in your creed,&#8221; drawled the other&mdash;&#8220;or
in your obedience. Few gentlemen of the Prince&#8217;s could find
a smile to-day, as you do, if their heads depended on it. Give
me the trick of it, sir,&#8221; he went on, with clumsy raillery.
&#8220;When all is lost&mdash;when we&#8217;re trapped like foxes, with three
armies closing in upon us&mdash;you take your snuff-box out, and
dust your nostrils, and smile as if these cursed Midlands were
a garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper&#8217;s distrust of the man yielded to a slow, unwilling
pity. He had so much, as he counted riches, and Murray
was so destitute, so in need of alms, that he spoke with quiet
friendliness, as if he taught a child that two and two, since
time&#8217;s beginning, added up to four.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the world&#8217;s a garden, to those who hold the Faith,&#8221;
he said slowly, searching for the one right word to express
what was plain to him as the road to London. &#8220;When all
seems losing, or lost altogether&mdash;are you so town-bred that
you do not know the darkest hour comes just before the
dawn&mdash;the dawn, if a man can keep himself in hand and
wait for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sentiments, Sir Jasper, do you credit,&#8221; sneered Murray,
stung by the sheer strength, the reality, of this man&#8217;s
outlook upon life. &#8220;They should be written, in a round, fair
hand, at the head of all good children&#8217;s copybooks. For ourselves,
we are men&mdash;and living in a rough-and-ready world&mdash;and
we know there are some dark hours that never lift to
dawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are none,&#8221; said Sir Jasper bluntly. &#8220;Believe me,
I talk of what I know. The black night always lifts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Murray strode forward impatiently, turned back, regarded
the other with an evasive glance. It was plain that, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
was his errand down Derby&#8217;s rainy main-street, he
brought a harassed mind to it. &#8220;You may be proved, sir,
sooner than you think. Suppose this Rising failed. Suppose
we were crushed like a hazel-nut between these three
converging armies; suppose the Prince were taken, and we
with him, would you stand on Tower Hill and say the dawn
was coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord Murray,&#8221; the other answered gravely, &#8220;we none
of us know, until the hour, whether our courage will prove
equal to our needs. But I say this. If I&#8217;m the man I&#8217;ve
drilled myself to be, if I can keep my eyes clear as they are
now&mdash;I will stand with you on Tower Hill, and you will know
that the dawn is very near to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gad, sir, you&#8217;re tough!&#8221; growled Murray. Piety had
shown to him till now as a dour, forbidding thing that made
fools or fanatics of men. He had not understood&mdash;though
the Highlanders should have taught him so much&mdash;that it
could be instinct with romance, and warmth, and well-being,
making endeavour and sacrifice a soldier&#8217;s road to the steep
hilltops of the certain dawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve need to be,&#8221; said Sir Jasper, with the same unalterable
simplicity. &#8220;There are too many weak-kneed folk with
us.&#8221; There was a pause, and he looked Murray in the face
as he had done just before their duel in the wood. &#8220;You go
to the Prince&#8217;s Council?&#8221; he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, since you&#8217;ve guessed as much&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will air your knowledge of arithmetic&mdash;will
argue that all&#8217;s lost already according to the known rules of
warfare. No, you need not disclaim. We know your mind.
My lord, I am in command only of a ragged company from
Lancashire, and not privileged to share your Council. But I
ask you to listen to a plain gentleman&#8217;s view of this adventure.
We follow no known rules, save that the straight road is the
readiest. We have one thought only&mdash;of advance. There
is the London road open to us, and no other, and God forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
you if you sound the note of retreat that will ruin all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My good Sir Jasper, my mind was made up long ago.
The world&#8217;s as it&#8217;s made, and battle is a crude reckoning up
of men, and arms, and odds&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the something more that you will not understand&mdash;the
something that has carried us to Derby, as by a miracle.
Listen, my lord! I ask you to listen. You go to this Council.
In an hour or so all will be settled, one way or the other.
Remember that you Highland chiefs have the Stuart&#8217;s honour
in your hands, the lives of all these simple Highlanders. You
know that the Prince has one mind only&mdash;to push forward&mdash;but
that you can overrule him if you will.&#8221; Sir Jasper&#8217;s
voice was strained and harsh, so eager was he to bring his
voice to the Council, if only by deputy. &#8220;You know, Lord
Murray, that the Highlanders are with their Prince, in
thought, in faith, in eagerness to run the gauntlet. You
know, too, that your Scots tradition bids them, liking it or no,
follow their chieftains first, their Prince afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am well aware of it. That is the weapon I mean to
make full use of, since you compel my candour.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a moment when men are apt to find unsuspected,
gusty feelings stir and cry for outlet. For neither to Sir
Jasper nor Lord Murray was there any doubt that the whole
well-being of England&mdash;England, thrifty, pleasant, mistress
of the seas, and royalist to the core of her strong, tender heart&mdash;rested
on this Council that was soon to make its choice
between opposing policies. And Lord Murray, in his own
cold fashion, believed that he was the wise counsellor of the
enterprise, enforcing prudence on hot-headed zealots; for
Murray was three parts honest, though he was cursed from
birth by lack of breadth and that practical, high imagination
which makes fine leaders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said Sir Jasper unexpectedly. &#8220;Till you
die, Lord Murray, you&#8217;ll regret your share in this. You&#8217;ve
gained many to your side, and may carry what you have in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
mind; but, if you have your way, I&#8217;d rather die on Tower
Hill than lie on the bed you&#8217;re making for yourself. You&#8217;ll
think better of it?&#8221; he broke off, with a quick tenderness
that surprised him. &#8220;You&#8217;re brave, you&#8217;re capable; surely
you will see the open road to London as I see it now&mdash;the
only road of honour. For your own sake&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For my own sake?&#8221; snapped Murray, moved against his
will. &#8220;Why should you care so much, sir, for what concerns
my happiness?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then again Sir Jasper did not know his mood, was not
master of the words that found their own heedless outlet.
&#8220;Why? Because, perhaps, we fought together&mdash;long ago, it
seems&mdash;because the man who wins a duel has always some
queer, tender liking for his adversary. My lord Murray, I
would wish to see you a strong man in this Council&mdash;strong
as the Prince himself. I wish&mdash;dear God! I wish to ride the
London road beside you, forgetting we once quarrelled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Murray&#8217;s face was hard as ever, but he was moved at last.
This Lancashire squire, whose strength could not be bought,
or tamed, or killed by ridicule, had found a way through all
defences of prudence and arithmetic. It was the moment,
had they known it, when the whole fate of the Rising was at
issue; for the great councils are shaped often by those haphazard
meetings in the streets that sway men&#8217;s moods beforehand.</p>

<p>And, as it chanced, Lochiel came swinging down the street,
on his way to join the Council&mdash;Lochiel, with his lean, upright
body, his gaiety, not lightly won, that made sunshine
between the mean, grey house-fronts&mdash;Lochiel, his wet kilt
swinging round his knees, and in his face the strong, tender
light that is bred of the big hills and the big, northern storms.</p>

<p>Murray glanced up the street, saw Lochiel. All finer impulses
were killed, as if a blight had fallen on them; for Murray
was ridden by the meanest of the sins, and was an abject
slave to jealousy.</p>

<p>Lochiel halted, and the three of them passed the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
day together, guardedly, knowing what was in the issue, and
reticent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come in a good hour, Lochiel&#8221; said Murray, with
the disdain that had never served him well. &#8220;Sir Jasper here
has been talking moonshine and high Faith. You&#8217;ll be
agreed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lochiel stood, just himself, schooled by hardship to a chivalry
that few men learn. &#8220;I think on most points we&#8217;re
agreed, Sir Jasper and I. It is a privilege to meet these
gentlemen of Lancashire; they know their mind and speak it.
They&#8217;ll not be bought, Murray, not even by Dame Prudence,
whose lap you sit in.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then Murray&#8217;s chilliness took fire. There was need,
even in his sluggish veins, to set the troubles of this venture
right by casual quarrels.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we find leisure, I shall seek satisfaction, Lochiel;
you&#8217;ll not deny it me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Lochiel laughed gently. &#8220;Dear Murray, I ask nothing
better. The only trouble is that we&#8217;ll be dead, the two
of us, long before the promised meeting, if you have your
way with the Council that is going to end old England or to
mend her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have my way,&#8221; growled the other, and passed down
the street.</p>

<p>Lochiel put his arm on Sir Jasper&#8217;s shoulder. He had no
gaiety now; his heart was aching, and he spoke as friend
to friend. &#8220;I believe him,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Murray had
always the gift of rallying doubters round him. The Duke
of Perth is staunch. Elcho is staunch, and a few others.
For the rest, they&#8217;ve been tempted by this glib talk of strategy.
Murray has persuaded them that we&#8217;ve marched to Derby
simply to retreat in good order; that we shall do better to
fall back on some imaginary host of friends who happened
to be late for the Rising, and who are eager now to join
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Retreat?&#8221; snapped Sir Jasper. &#8220;The devil coined that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
word, Lochiel. Murray&#8217;s shrewd and a Scotsman and no
coward; he should know that the good way lies forward
always.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Lochiel, because he was so heart-sick and so
tired of strategy, fell into that light mood which touches men
at times when they&#8217;re in danger of breaking under stress of
feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only think of one case where your gospel fails,&#8221; he
said, with the quick, boyish smile that sat oddly on his
harassed face. &#8220;Retreat in good order, sir, has been known
to carry honour with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know of none, Lochiel,&#8221; insisted the other, in his downright
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Potiphar&#8217;s wife, perhaps. And, there, Sir Jasper,
you think me flippant; and I tell you that my heart is as near
to breaking as any Hielandman&#8217;s in Derby. It is a queer,
disastrous pain, this heartbreak.&#8221; Lochiel&#8217;s shoulders
drooped a little. The wind came raving down the street
and made him shiver as with ague. Then his weakness
passed, and he lifted his trim, buoyant head to any hardship
that was coming. &#8220;Fools&#8217; hearts may break,&#8221; he said sharply.
&#8220;For me, I&#8217;ll see this trouble through. I&#8217;ll find a glimpse
of blue sky somewhere; aye, Sir Jasper, though Murray sets
the darkness of the pit about us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men looked gravely at each other, as comrades do.
They were of the like unalterable faith; they were chilled by
this constant drag upon a march that, left to the leader of
it, would have gone forward blithely.</p>

<p>Most of all, perhaps, they felt the weakness that was the
keystone of their whole position. The Highlanders were
eager for the Prince, would have laid down their lives for
him, wished only for the forward march and the battle against
odds; but, deep in those hidden places of the soul where the
far-back fathers have planted legacies, they were obedient
to the tradition that a Highlandman follows his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
chief, though the King himself bids him choose a happier and
more pleasant road.</p>

<p>Lochiel knew this, as a country squire knows the staunch
virtues, whims, and failings of his tenantry; and because his
knowledge was so sure, he feared the issue of this Council.
Murray could never have won the rank and file; but he had
captured the most part of the chiefs, who had been leading
too easy lives these late days and had softened to the call
of prudence. And the Council, in its view of it, had come
already to a decision shameful and disastrous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Jasper,&#8221; said Lochiel suddenly, &#8220;we go pitying ourselves,
and that is always waste of time. What of the Prince?
I cannot tell you the love&mdash;the love proven to the hilt&mdash;I have
for him. We give our little to this rising; but he, brave
soul, gives all. No detail of our men&#8217;s comfort in this
evil weather, no cheery word when the world goes very ill
with us, has been neglected. And, above the detail&mdash;oh,
above the detail that frets his nerves to fiddle-strings&mdash;he
keeps the single goal ahead. He keeps the bridge of faith,
Sir Jasper, with a gallantry that makes me weak about my
mother&#8217;s knees again, as if&mdash;as if I did not need to be
ashamed of tears.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper passed a hand across his eyes. He had kept,
through the rough journey of his sixty years, a passionate
devotion to the Stuart; and he had travelled with Prince
Charles Edward, as wayfarers do with wayfarers, through
sleety roads, and had found, as few men do, that his fine,
chivalrous ideal was less than the reality. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been near
his Highness often,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;He kept his temper
firm on the rein when I could not have done. He went about
the camp o&#8217; nights, when most of his gentry were asleep, and
tended ailing Highlanders. He&#8217;s as big as Pendle Hill in
Lancashire; and, Lochiel, keep a good heart through this
Council, for he was cast in a bigger mould than most of
us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>&#8220;He&mdash;is royal,&#8221; said Lochiel softly. &#8220;That is all. Put
him in peasant&#8217;s homespun, with his love-locks shorn, he&#8217;d be
still&mdash;why, just the Stuart, reigning from the hilltops over
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, Lochiel, you talked of heartbreak. We&#8217;re lesser
men, and can jog along somehow if the worst comes. The
Prince cannot. The heart of him&mdash;it&#8217;s like a well-grown
oak, Lochiel; it will stand upright to the storm, or it will
break. There is no middle way.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then Lochiel remembered he would be late for the
Council if he stayed longer in the windy street. &#8220;There
never was a middle way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You, sir&mdash;and the
Prince, God bless him!&mdash;and Lochiel of the many weaknesses,
we never trod the middle way.&#8221;</p>

<p>And somehow a great sorrow and great liking came to
them, as if they were brothers parting in the thick of a
stormy night where ways divided.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall meet soon again,&#8221; said Lochiel, the foolish
trouble in his voice. &#8220;And, either way this Council goes,
we&#8217;ll find a strip of blue sky over us, Sir Jasper.&#8221;</p>

<p>He swung down the street, his head upright and his figure
lithe and masterful. He might, to all outward seeming, have
been going to his own wedding. For that was Lochiel&#8217;s way
when hope and courage were at their lowest ebb, when he conquered
his weakness by disdaining it.</p>

<p>And Sir Jasper watched him go&mdash;watched other chieftains
hurrying, with grave, set faces, to the Council. And then,
for three long hours, he paced the streets. What Rupert,
his heir, was learning there at Windyhough the father
learned during this time of waiting for the news. The chiefs
were in the thick of debate, were speaking out their minds,
were guessing, from the shifting issues of the Council, which
way the wind was sitting. They were in the fighting-line at
least; but he, whose heart was centred wholly on this Council
that would settle all, was compelled to stand by helpless to
serve his Prince by word or deed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>He was not alone. It was an open secret that, behind the
closed doors of the Council Chamber, men were deciding
whether retreat or advance should be the day&#8217;s marching-order.
Discipline was ended for awhile. The Highlanders
could not rest in their lodgings, but stood about the streets
in crowds, or in little knots, seeking what make-believe Derby
town could give them of the free air and the big, roomy hills
that, in gladness or in sorrow, were needful to them as the
food they ate. The townsfolk, stirred from their sleepiness
by all this hubbub of tattered, rain-sodden men who were
bent on some errand dimly understood, mixed with the
soldiery, and asked foolish questions, and got few answers,
because the most part of the army spoke only Gaelic.</p>

<p>The whole town, though men&#8217;s voices were low and hushed,
was alive with that stress of feeling which is like a brewing
thunderstorm. Men gathered into crowds, saying little,
affect each other, till each feels in his own person the sum
total of his neighbour&#8217;s restlessness; and for that reason
armies yield suddenly to a bewildering panic, or to a selfless
courage that leads to high victories in face of odds.</p>

<p>The wind swept down the streets of Derby. The rain was
tireless. It did not matter. To Sir Jasper&mdash;to the men of
Lancashire, and the Highlandmen who were old to sorrow of
the hills&mdash;there was nothing mattered, save the news for
which they waited. And the time dragged on. And still
the Council doors were shut.</p>

<p>Then, late in the afternoon, Lord Murray came out, and
walked up the street, with half a dozen of his intimates beside
him. And, a little later, Lochiel came out, alone, and,
after him, the Duke of Perth, alone. And Sir Jasper, standing
near the Council Chamber, knew at a glance which side
had won the day.</p>

<p>Last of all&mdash;a long while after, so it seemed to Sir Jasper&mdash;the
Prince crossed the threshold, stood for a moment, as if
stunned, with the rain and the spiteful wind against his cheek.
He was like one grown old before his time&mdash;one bent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
broken up by some disaster that had met his manhood by the
way.</p>

<p>Then, as Lochiel had done when he went down the street
to this unhappy Council, the Prince lifted his head, squared
his shoulders to the wind, and stepped out between the silent
bystanders as if life were a jest to him. So then Sir Jasper
was sure that retreat was the order of the day; was sure,
too, that his Prince had never shown so simple and conspicuous
a gallantry as he did now, when he moved through the
people as if he went to victory, not to a heartache that would
last him till he lay, dead and at peace, beside his Stuart kinsmen.</p>

<p>At dawn of the next day the retreat began. It was a red
dawn and stormy, though the rain had ceased, and the
wisp of a dying moon was lying on her back above the dismal
housetops.</p>

<p>The Prince stood aside and watched it all. A little while
before he had bidden Lord Murray ride at the head of the
outgoing army. &#8220;I have no strategy, my lord,&#8221; he had said,
with chiselled irony. &#8220;I lead only when attack comes from
the front.&#8221; And Sir Jasper, with the instinct of old loyalty
and new-found, passionate liking for the man, had drawn his
own horse near to the Prince&#8217;s bridle; and they waited, the
two of them, till the sad procession passed, as if to burial of
their finest hopes.</p>

<p>Not till Derby&#8217;s life is ended will she hear such trouble
and such master-music as went up and down her streets on
that disastrous, chilly dawn. The Highlanders were strong
and simple-hearted men. They had obeyed their leaders,
rather than the Prince who had sounded the forward note of
battle. But no old allegiance could silence their pipers, who
played a dirge to Prince Charles Edward, heir to the English
throne.</p>

<p>By one consent, it seemed, the pipers, as they went by their
Prince, played only the one air. Low, insistent, mournful as
the mists about their own wild hills, the air roamed up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
down the wet, quiet streets, till it seemed there had been no
other music since the world began. There was no hope, no
quick compelling glamour, as of old; the pipes, it seemed, were
broken-hearted like their leader, and they could only play for
sorrow.</p>

<p>Up and down the long, mean street, and down and up,
between the wet house-fronts that reared themselves to the
dying moon and the red murk of the dawn, the music roamed.
And always it was the same air&mdash;the dirge known as &#8220;The
Flowers of the Forest,&#8221; which was brought to birth when the
Scots lost Flodden Field. Since Flodden, generation after
generation, men skilled at the pipes had taught their growing
youngsters the way of it; and now the ripe training of the
fathers had gathered to a head. No pipers ever played, or ever
will again, as those who greeted the Prince as they passed by
him&mdash;greeted him, with sadness and with music, as heroes salute
a comrade proven and well-loved.</p>

<p>The riders and the men on foot went by. The tread of
hoofs, the tread of feet, was slow and measured, as the tread
of mourners is; and down and up, and up and down, the echoes
of the pipes&#8217; lament roamed through Derby&#8217;s street. It was
an hour&mdash;and there are few such&mdash;when men, with their
strength and their infirmities, and their rooted need of battle,
grow tender and outspoken as little children, who have found
no need as yet to face life in the open.</p>

<p>The Prince and Sir Jasper were alone. The fighting men
had passed them, and the chattering townsfolk. And from
afar, down the silence of the empty street, the sorrow of the
pipes came with a low, recurring lilt.</p>

<p>Lochiel, not long ago, had sounded the right note. They
were children, Sir Jasper and his Prince, gathered round their
mothers&#8217; knees again; and, through the murk of Derby&#8217;s street,
and through the falling sorrow of the music, God spoke to
them, as if they needed, in this hour of extreme weakness, to
reach out and hold with firm hands the faith that was slipping
from their grasp.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>And the moment passed, leaving them the sadder, but the
stronger for it. And they were men again&mdash;comrades, facing
a disastrous world. And presently they rode slowly out of
Derby, and took the long road north again; and between them
fell a silence chill and heavy as the rain that never ceased to
whip the puddles of the highway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your eyes are wet, Sir Jasper,&#8221; said the Prince, turning
sharply from the thoughts that were too heavy to be borne.</p>

<p>&#8220;So are yours, your Highness,&#8221; the other answered gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, we&#8217;ll blame the pipes for it. I think&mdash;there&#8217;s
something broken in me, sir, since&mdash;since Derby; but no man
in my army, except yourself, shall ever guess as much. We
shall be gay, Sir Jasper, since need asks.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few hours later a motley company of horse&mdash;three-and-twenty
strong&mdash;rode into Derby. Some half-dozen of the
riders were English, but the rest, and the officer in command,
were Hessian soldiery. The officer, one Captain Goldstein,
spoke English with some fluency; and his business here, it
seemed, was to gather from the townsfolk such details of the
retreat as they could furnish.</p>

<p>They spent less than an hour in the town, snatched a hurried
meal&mdash;for which, unlike the Prince&#8217;s men, they did not pay&mdash;and
rode back as fast as they could set hoofs to ground to the
main body of the Duke of Cumberland&#8217;s army, which had been
hanging on the rear of the Stuart&#8217;s men for many days, hoping
always to overtake them, and always finding them a few leagues
nearer London than themselves.</p>

<p>Captain Goldstein went straight to the Duke&#8217;s lodgings, and
the sentry passed him in without demur when his challenge
had been answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, good!&#8221; said Cumberland gruffly, looking up from a
map which he was studying. &#8220;What news from Derby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The best news. They&#8217;ve turned tail, though we could not
credit the rumours that came into camp. Derby is empty, your
Grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men were oddly like each other, as they stood in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
lamplit room. They were big and fleshy, both of them; and
each had the thick, loose lips, the heavy jaw, that go with an
aggressive lust for the coarser vices, an aggressive ambition,
and a cruelty in the handling of all hindrances.</p>

<p>Cumberland drained the tankard at his elbow, thrust his
boots a little nearer to the fire-blaze. &#8220;What fools these Stuarts
are!&#8221; he said lazily.</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave, no,&#8221; said Captain Goldstein, wishing to be
exact in detail. &#8220;From all I gathered, it was not the Pretender,
but the leaders of the clans, who forced the retreat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, either way, it&#8217;s laughable. The Elector bars their
way at Finchley with ten thousand men; it sounds formidable,
Goldstein, eh? but we know what a rotten nut that is to crack.
And I could not overtake them; they march with such cursed
speed; and poor old Marshal Wade, supposed to be converging
from the north, is always a week late for the fair. They held
the cards; and, Goldstein, are you jesting when you say that
they&#8217;ve retreated?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never jest, your Grace. Derby is empty, I say; and it is
not my place to suggest that you order boot-and-saddle to be
sounded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; snarled Cumberland, facing round on this officer
whom he was wont to kick or caress, according to his mood.
&#8220;No, Goldstein, it is not your place. Your place? You&#8217;d be
housed in the kennels if you had your proper lodgings. I rescued
you from that sort of neighbourhood, because you seemed
to have the makings of a soldier in you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll retreat with speed, as they advanced. The wind&#8217;s
in the feet of these Highlanders,&#8221; said Goldstein stubbornly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall catch them up. To-day I&#8217;ve much to do, Goldstein&mdash;an
assignation with the miller&#8217;s buxom daughter, a mile
outside the camp; she&#8217;s waiting for me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll wait, sir, till your return. You have that gift with
women.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cumberland stirred lazily, got to his feet. He was pleased
by this flattery that was clumsy as his own big, unwholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
body. &#8220;She&#8217;ll wait, you think? Well, let her wait. Women
are best trained that way. There, Goldstein, I was only jesting.
You broke the good news too sharply. They&#8217;ve retreated?
Say it again. Oh, the fools these Stuarts are! I
must drink another measure to their health.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later the whole Hanoverian army moved north.
Cumberland was keen and happy, because he saw butchery and
renown within his grasp. Through days and weeks of hardship
over sloppy roads he had hunted the Stuart whom he
loathed, had found him constantly elude pursuit. And now,
it seemed, his hour of triumph was at hand. And triumph, to
his Grace of Cumberland, meant always, not pardon of his enemies,
but revenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;They leave us a plain track to follow,&#8221; he said to Goldstein
as, near midday, after riding slantwise from their camp to
strike the northern road, eight miles north of Derby, they came
from muddied bridle-paths to a highway that was deep in trampled
slush. &#8220;They were nimble in advance, but retreat will
have another tale to tell. We shall catch them to-morrow, or
the next day after.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Goldstein agreed; but he did not tell all he knew&mdash;how
he had learned from the Derby townsfolk that the Prince rode
far behind his army, attended only by one horseman. Instead,
he spoke of the commission he held, as officer in command of a
roving troop of cavalry, and asked if he might be free to harass
the retreat.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ride lighter than your main body, your Highness, and
could pick off stragglers as well as bring news of the route
these ragged Pretender&#8217;s men are taking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ride forward,&#8221; growled Cumberland. &#8220;You&#8217;ve the
pick of my scoundrels with you, Goldstein&mdash;hard riders and
coarse feeders&mdash;they&#8217;ll help you pick off stragglers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men exchanged a glance of understanding. Difference
of rank apart, they were brotherly in the instincts that
they shared; and his Grace of Cumberland, from his youth up,
had had a gift for choosing his friends among those who rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
unencumbered by conscience, or pity, or any sort of tenderness.
And, as he had said just now, he found them mostly in the kennels.</p>

<p>&#8220;One word,&#8221; said Cumberland, as the other prepared to ride
forward. &#8220;There&#8217;s no quarter to be given. For the country&#8217;s
sake&mdash;for the safety of the King&mdash;we shall make an example
of these rebels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Goldstein glanced warily at him, to see if he jested and
looked for an answering wink. But it pleased the Duke to assume
an air which he thought royal.</p>

<p>&#8220;An example, you understand?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Tell these
gentle devils of yours that they can ride on a free rein. If you
scotch a Pretender&#8217;s man, put your heel on him and kill him
outright. Our royal safety&mdash;England&#8217;s safety&mdash;depends on
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Goldstein, as he spurred forward to gather his cavalry together,
grinned pleasantly. &#8220;Our royal safety&mdash;England&#8217;s
safety,&#8221; he muttered, mimicking the Duke&#8217;s rough, broken accent.
&#8220;He&#8217;s got it pat by heart, though it seems yesterday he
crossed from Hanover.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gathered his men, and rode forward at their head through
the rain and the sleety mud that marked the passage of the
Highlanders. And when they had gone three miles or so on
the northern road, they captured a frightened countryman,
who was getting his sheep down from the pastures in anticipation
of the coming snow. It was the first blood they had drawn
in this campaign, and Goldstein made the most of it. He liked
to have a weak thing at his mercy, and he spared the farmer no
threat of what would follow if he failed to tell the truth. For
his pains, he learned that the Highlanders were marching fast
along the northern road, five hours ahead of them. He learned,
too, that one who answered to the Prince&#8217;s description still rode
behind his army, and that he was accompanied only by one gentleman
on horseback.</p>

<p>They went forward, leaving the countryman half-dazed with
fright; and presently Goldstein&#8217;s men began to murmur at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
hardships of the road. A rough company at best, united only
by a common lust of pillage and rapine, they needed a firmer
hand on them than one promoted from their own ranks could
give.</p>

<p>Goldstein, knowing this, drew them up in line. And first he
stormed at them, without avail; for they were harder swearers
than himself, and missed that crisp, adventurous flow of tongue
which comes to gentlemen-officers at these times. So then,
seeing them mutinous and like to get further out of hand the
more he stormed, he grinned pleasantly at them. &#8220;My orders
from the Duke,&#8221; he said, &#8220;are to capture the Pretender, dead
or alive, before he gets back to Scotland. There&#8217;s thirty thousand
pounds on his head. He rides alone behind his army, as
you heard just now, and we shall share the plunder.&#8221;</p>

<p>The appeal went home this time, for Goldstein knew his men.
They bivouacked that night four miles wide of Macclesfield, in
Cheshire, and the next day&mdash;the sun showing his face at last
through tattered, grey-blue clouds&mdash;they came in sight of the
Stuart army. They had crossed by a bridle-track which, from
a little knoll, gave them a view of the long, straight highway
that stretched, a grey, rain-sodden ribbon, between the empty
fields. They saw kilted men go by, and horsemen riding at a
foot pace; and they heard the pipes that could not anyway be
still, as they played that air of &#8220;The Flowers of the Forest&#8221;
which was both dirge and battle-song. And Goldstein, somewhere
under the thick hide he carried like a suit of armour,
was stirred by the strength and forlornness of it all. He saw
great-hearted men go by, shoulders carried square against retreat,
and, in some crude, muddled fashion, he understood that
they were of fibre stronger than his own. He sat there in saddle,
moodily watching the horse and foot go by. There was
no chance as yet to pick off stragglers, for the army kept in
close order; yet Goldstein waited after the last company had
ridden by&mdash;they chanced to be the MacDonald clan&mdash;as if he
looked for some happening on the empty road below.</p>

<p>And presently, while his men began to fidget under this inaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
in the rain, two horsemen came round the bend of the
highway. The Prince and Sir Jasper were riding together
still, but were talking no longer of the Rising and retreat. Instead,
they were laughing at some tale the Prince had lately
brought from France; and Sir Jasper was bettering French
wit by a story, rough and racy and smelling of the soil, which
he had heard at the last meet of hounds in Lancashire before
he set out on this sterner ride. For women, when they are
heart-sick, find ease in rending characters to shreds, especially
sister-women&#8217;s; but men need the honest ease of laughter,
whether the jest be broad or subtle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Jasper,&#8221; said the Prince, &#8220;you&#8217;re vastly likeable.
When I come to my own, you shall dine with me and set the
table in a roar. Meanwhile&mdash;a pinch of snuff with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper dusted his nostrils, with the spacious air that set
well on him. And then, from old habit, he glanced up, in search
of the hills that were food and drink to him in time of trouble.
He saw no hills worth the name; but, for lack of them, his
eyes rested on a mound, wide of his bridle-hand, which from
lack of true proportion the country-folk named Big Blue Hill.
There was little inspiration to be gathered from the mound;
so he looked out with his world&#8217;s eyes again, and saw that there
were horsemen gathered on the rise, and that they wore the
enemy&#8217;s livery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness, we must gallop,&#8221; he said briefly.</p>

<p>The Prince, following his glance, saw Goldstein plucking his
horse into a trot. &#8220;I prefer to wait,&#8221; he said lazily. &#8220;It is a
skirmish of this sort I hoped for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your Highlanders? We&#8217;re in the open without a wall
to set our backs to. You <i>dare</i> not leave your Highlanders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, I dare not.&#8221; He glanced wistfully at the down-riding
men, as if death in the open were easier to him just now
than life. &#8220;It is retreat once more? Dear God, I must have
sinned, to have this sickness put on me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our horses are fresh. We&#8217;ll give them Tally-Ho, your
Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>Through the darkness and the trouble of his soul, through
the wish to die here and now and lie in forgetfulness of Derby
and retreat, the Prince caught up some tattered remnants of
the Stuart courage. It was easy to wait, sword ready, for the
oncoming; but it was hard to gallop from an enemy he loathed.
Yet from the discipline of that long peril shared with his men,
since they came on the forlorn hope from Scotland, the strength
that does not fail returned to Prince Charles Edward. He set
his mare&mdash;Nance Demaine&#8217;s mare&mdash;to the gallop; and Sir Jasper
rode keen and hard beside him; and Goldstein found his
heavy horse slip and lurch under him, as all his company did
while they blundered in pursuit. Goldstein followed headlong.
Three of his troopers came to ground in galloping down a
greasy slope, and their leader, if he had been a worse horseman,
would have shared the same fate. As it was, he kept
forward, and at a bend of the road saw, half a mile ahead,
the company of MacDonalds who kept the rear of the Stuart
army.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not to-day we catch him,&#8221; he snapped, reining up
and facing the ill-tempered men behind him. &#8220;We can bide
our time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, we&#8217;ve been biding a good while,&#8221; growled a weather-beaten
trooper. &#8220;Whichever way his back&#8217;s turned, this
cursed Pretender always slips out of reach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The money&#8217;s on his head, you fools!&#8221; snapped Goldstein.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll mutiny against God or man, but not against thirty
thousand pounds, if I know your breed. There&#8217;s to-morrow;
we shall catch him soon or late, while this mood is on him to
ride behind his army.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were sobered by this hint of money. For they were
men who plied for hire, and only hire. And that night they
encamped on the outskirts of Manchester, where the Prince&#8217;s
army lay, and dreamed they were rich men all. And the next
morning they were almost cheerful, this ragged cavalry of
Goldstein&#8217;s, because the day&#8217;s hunt was up, and because their
view of the Rising was narrowed to each man&#8217;s share of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
blood-money when they took Prince Charles Edward, dead or
alive.</p>

<p>Up at Windyhough, in Lancashire, this same red dawn had
shone through the open window of Rupert&#8217;s bedchamber, rousing
him from uneasy slumber. He had gone to the casement,
and was looking out at the grim majestic moors. Line after
line the rugged spurs and knolls strode up from the night mists
into the crimson and purple that gained in splendour every
moment. Of a truth, it was a man&#8217;s land; and the thought
goaded Rupert into deep and passionate self-pity, as it had
always done. Over the hills yonder his father rode beside
the Stuart&mdash;men going on a manly errand. Perhaps they
had fought their big battle already, were hastening to a London
eager to receive the conquerors. And he? He was
playing at the defence of a house remote from any chance
of action. And there was Nance, waiting for him to prove
himself, growing cold and contemptuous because each new day
found him still Rupert the Dreamer, inept, irritable, a burden
to himself and others.</p>

<p>Perhaps, out of the sympathy that had always bound Sir
Jasper and his heir together, the like mood had come to both
just now, the like need to face a stern and awful sickness of
the soul, to win through it, to plant Faith&#8217;s standard in the wilderness
of defeat and hope deferred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nance was right. Nothing will ever again happen at Windyhough,
until my father returns from the crowning&mdash;and then
the work will be done, and no more need of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stubbornly, slowly, he came to a better heart and mind. Undoubtedly
this scholar had pluck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not give in,&#8221; he said, lifting his head to the ruddy
heath as if answering a challenge.</p>

<p>And at that hour the Prince and his father were riding north
from Derby&mdash;were riding nearer to him than he thought, on a
journey whose end no man could foresee.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE TALE COMES TO WINDYHOUGH</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Nearly</span> a week had gone since Nance came down from her
ride on the moor, from the meeting with Will Underwood that
had ruined one dream of her life for good and all. Each day
that passed was more full of strain for those at Windyhough.
They practised musketry together, she and Rupert and old
Simon Foster; and the rivalry between them, keen enough,
improved their marksmanship. At the week&#8217;s end Rupert was
the best shot of the three; it was his way to be thorough, and
to this business of countering Nance&#8217;s taunt&mdash;that she could
not trust her men to guard her&mdash;he brought the same untiring
zeal, the patience not to be dismayed, that had kept his faith
secure against disastrous odds.</p>

<p>But as each short day closed in there was the return to the
silence of the house at Windyhough, to Lady Royd&#8217;s wonder
if her husband were lying dead in some south country ditch,
to the yapping of the toy spaniel that harassed Rupert because,
soul and body, he was tired of mimic warfare.</p>

<p>They had come home this afternoon from musket-drill, and
Simon had left them in the courtyard. A little, sobbing wind
was fluting round the gables, and the red light on the hills
foretold, unerringly, that snow would come.</p>

<p>Nance looked up at the black front of Windyhough. The
homeless desolation of the land took hold of her. She was
cold, and tired of all things; and she sought for some relief,
and could find none, save by way of the tongue that is woman&#8217;s
rapier.</p>

<p>&#8220;What of your trust, Rupert?&#8221; she asked sharply. &#8220;A
week ago&mdash;it seems half a lifetime&mdash;you said there would be
some swift attack&mdash;you said that you had faith. Faith, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
dear&mdash;I tell you it is cold and empty as the wind. Your only
answer is&mdash;why, just your mother&#8217;s spaniel barking at you
from within. Faith should know the master&#8217;s footstep, Rupert.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been sick at heart till now. The answer had not
come as soon as he had hoped, and his need was urgent; but
the faith in him rose clear and dominant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a baby, Nance. You talked of half a lifetime. I
could wait so long in patience, knowing the Stuart, soon or
late, would come to the good crowning.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced at him with impatience, with a certain
wistful curiosity. &#8220;Does your creed go deep as that, Rupert?
Mine does not,&#8221; she said, with her frank, bewildering
honesty.</p>

<p>&#8220;My creed?&#8221; Rupert&#8217;s shoulders were squared in earnest
now. He stood to his full six feet, and in his eyes was that
look of the man who cannot be bought, or bullied, or flattered,
from allegiance to the straight road ahead. &#8220;It goes deeper,
Nance. What else? Faith! You seem to think it means
only kneeling in a church, a woman&#8217;s refuge from the outside
storms, a ball to play with, when the time seems slow in passing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will tell me more,&#8221; said Nance gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot. Go to Sir Jasper, who can use a sword; go to
your father, who can fight and hunt and play the man wherever
men are gathered. They kneel in church, Nance&mdash;and in the
open roads they feel their swords the cleaner for it; they carry
knighthood with them, so that clowns read it in their faces as
they pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who taught you this?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>He laughed, with the diffidence and self-contempt that always
lay in ambush for him. &#8220;I dreamed it, maybe. You
always said I was a dreamer, Nance&mdash;a fool, you meant, but
were too kind to think it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they stood there, in the cold and ruddy gloaming, and
were helpless to find speech together. All that lay deep in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Nance, secure beneath each day&#8217;s indignities, went out to this
heir of Windyhough. His view of life was hers; his roots
were in the soil, tilled lovingly by far-back fathers, that breeds
the strong plants of chivalry. And yet&mdash;and yet he was so
fitful in his moods, so apart from the needs of every day, so
galling to the women who looked, as a matter of course, for
their men to go out into the open.</p>

<p>And then, following some odd byway of memory, she recalled
how grim and steady and reliant he had been that winter&#8217;s
day&mdash;it seemed long since&mdash;when he had sent Will Underwood
and herself down the moor while he prepared to
fight out the quarrel with his younger brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rupert,&#8221; she said, seeking for some way of praising him,
&#8220;you shot well to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;I outshot a woman, Nance&mdash;and a
man who was crippled in every joint he owned. I take no
praise for that. As men count shooting, I&#8217;m where I always
stood&mdash;your patient fool, Nance.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they stood helpless there, one aching with the love he had&mdash;each
day of this close companionship making Nance more
lovable and more far off&mdash;the other stifled by her pity for this
heir of Windyhough, who needed so little to touch his manhood
into living flame.</p>

<p>And as they stood a horseman came clattering up. There
was mud on his horse, so that none could have told whether it
were roan or black or chestnut. There was mud on his clothes,
and on his hands, and on his lean, strained face. As he reined
up sharply, his gift of knowing faces and their records did not
fail him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Sir Jasper&#8217;s son?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad, sir, to
meet you out of doors, for it will save me time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert was aware of some sense of betterment. Dimly, and
far off as yet, he saw the answer to his faith take shape and
substance. &#8220;I remember you, sir,&#8221; he answered gravely.
&#8220;You are Mr. Oliphant of Muirhouse, and once you&mdash;you
praised my shortcomings. You&mdash;you helped me, sir, that night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
you came to Windyhough. You do not guess the debt I owe
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant, sick with hard riding, more sick with the disastrous
news that he was bringing to the loyal north, halted for
remembrance of that night when he had come to Sir Jasper&#8217;s
and found Lady Royd and a slim, nerve-ridden lad who was
vastly like his own dead self, buried long ago under the hills of
fine endeavour.</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave, sir,&#8221; he said, gently as if the pipes were
sobbing for dead hopes, &#8220;I think you&#8217;ve pluck enough to hear
bad news and take it like a soldier. All&#8217;s lost&mdash;at Derby&mdash;and
the Prince&#8217;s men are coming north again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance went apart and put weak, foolish hands about her
eyes. There could be no resurrection, she fancied, from this
death in life that was meant by the retreat from Derby. But
Rupert held his head up and looked at Oliphant with steady
eyes. The blow was sudden and bewildering; this retreat cut
deep into his faith, his certainty that the Prince could not fail
to carry London; and his shoulders broadened to the burden,
so that he carried it well&mdash;almost lightly, as it seemed to Nance.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father&mdash;he is safe, sir?&#8221; he asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, safe; but his temper is like a watch-dog&#8217;s on the
chain&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll bite deeper when the chance comes.&#8221; Rupert was
smiling gravely through his eagerness. &#8220;Mr. Oliphant, I&mdash;I
dare not ask you what&mdash;what my father&mdash;and the Prince&mdash;and
the Highlanders&mdash;are feeling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant set a rough hand on his arm. &#8220;Feeling? The
whole route north is one long burial. I&#8217;ve seen battle, I&#8217;ve
heard the wounded crying when the night-wind crept into their
wounds, but I never met anguish as I met it on the road from
Derby. My lad, I cannot speak of it&mdash;and the Prince among
them all, with a jest on his lips to hearten them, and his face
as if he danced a minuet&mdash;all but the eyes, the saddened eyes&mdash;the
eyes, I think, of martyred Charles, when he stepped to the
scaffold on a bygone January morning and bade us all <i>remember</i>.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Oliphant halted a moment. A fury, resolute and quiet,
was on him. &#8220;By God, sir, some few of us are not likely to
forget!&#8221;</p>

<p>And suddenly Nance sobbed aloud, though she had never
learned the woman&#8217;s trick of easy tears. And about Oliphant&#8217;s
face, too, a softness played. It was a moment for these three
such as comes seldom to any of us&mdash;a moment packed so full
with grief and tragedy that they must needs slip off the masks
worn at usual times. They three were of the old Faith, the
old, unquestioning loyalty. They had no intrigues, of policy
or caution, to hide from one another. One of the three had
been with the army of retreat, had felt the throb and pity that
put a finer edge to the sword he carried; and two of them
waited here at Windyhough, sending long thoughts out to help
the wayfarers. And now there was an end, it seemed; and in
the chilly gloaming their hearts met, caught fire, were friendly
in a common grief.</p>

<p>As for Rupert, he felt his soul go free to prison; he was
finding now the answer to the unhappy, ceaseless trouble he
had undergone since childhood. He had been thrust aside by
folk more practical and matter-of-fact; he had feared ridicule;
he had heard men name him scholarly, and had retreated, like
a snail into its shell, to the dreams of gallantry that were food
and drink to him. But through it all he had kept one bridge
against all comers&mdash;the bridge of his simple, knightly faith;
and it is the big deeds such as this&mdash;wrought out in silence, so
that none guesses them&mdash;that train a man for the forlorn
hope, the sudden call, the need to step out into the open
when there is no one else to face odds ludicrous and overwhelming.</p>

<p>It was Rupert who broke the silence, and his voice was deep
and steady. &#8220;Mr. Oliphant,&#8221; he said, not knowing how the
words came to him, &#8220;this may be for the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Oliphant, who was saddle-sore and human, snapped round
on him. &#8220;By gad, sir, you are obstinately cheerful! Ride
somewhere between here and Derby, and ask the Highlanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
if all is for the best. I tell you I have seen the Prince&#8217;s face,
and faith grows dull. He would be in London now, if he had
had his way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert glanced up to the moors, where the last tattered banners
of the sunset fluttered crimson on the hilltops. And in
his eyes was the look which any countryman of Lancashire, or
any Highlander from Skye, would have known as &#8220;seeing
far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince has not had his way,&#8221; he said, with queer, unhurried
certainty. &#8220;You tell us he retreats as other men go to
a ball. You say his heart is breaking, sir, and that he still finds
jests. I know retreat and waiting&mdash;know them by heart&mdash;and
the going is not smooth. If he can do this&mdash;why, he&#8217;s bigger
even than my dreams of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance understood him now; and Oliphant&#8217;s ill-temper ceased
to trouble him. Here was one, bred of a soldier-stock, who
had missed his way along the road of deeds; but to the bone of
him he was instinct, not with the ballad-stuff of victory, but
with the tedious prose of long, sick marches, of defeat carried
with shoulders squared to any onset of adversity.</p>

<p>Oliphant laughed grimly. It was his way when feeling
waded so deep that it was like to carry him away. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen
many countries, lad&mdash;have had my back to the wall a few times,
knowing who stood by me and who found excuse to save his
skin; but I never in my travels met one so like a man, round
and about, find him in rough weather or in smooth, as&mdash;as
the Prince, God bless him! The ladies up in Edinburgh&mdash;your
pardon, Miss Demaine, but some of your sex are fools paramount&mdash;saw
only his love-locks and the rest of it; but we have
seen his manhood. There&#8217;s none like him. And he retreats
because my Lord George Murray is mathematical and has captured
the Scots prudence of the chiefs; and he&#8217;s still the great
gentleman among us&mdash;greater now that he dances, not in Holyrood,
but through the miry roads.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance glanced up sharply. She was thinking of Will Underwood,
who had killed first love for her with a clown&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
rough hand. &#8220;If there were more men of your breed&mdash;and
Rupert&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave,&#8221; broke in Oliphant gruffly, &#8220;I think most
of us are bred straight. The mongrels make such an uproar
that you fancy them a full pack in cry, Miss Demaine. We&#8217;re
not happy, not one of us three; but we carry a faith bigger than
our hardships.&#8221; He turned to Rupert with surprising grace
and charm. &#8220;My thanks, sir. I was tired before I met you,
and now&mdash;my weariness is gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door of Windyhough was opened suddenly, and Lady
Royd came running out bareheaded, and halted on seeing the
horseman and the two on foot in the falling dusk of the courtyard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rupert, I cannot find my little dog!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>Her elder-born smiled grimly. He was struggling with the
need to stand firm against Oliphant&#8217;s disastrous news; and his
mother came to tell him, in her pretty, querulous way, that her
little dog was missing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fido is in the house, mother,&#8221; he answered patiently. &#8220;We
heard him barking at us when we crossed the courtyard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is not Fido. It&#8217;s the little black pug, Rupert. And
she&#8217;s so delicate. An hour of this keen wind, if she is out of
doors, might kill the poor, wee doggie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant of Muirhouse gave a muttered curse, for, to his
finger-tips, he was a man, his instincts primitive when they
were touched. Then he laughed gently, for his soul&#8217;s health,
and got from saddle, and stooped to kiss Lady Royd&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not know me, Lady Royd, in this dim light? I&#8217;m
Oliphant of Muirhouse, and I bring Rising news.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper&#8217;s wife put a hand to her breast. The movement
was quick, and another than Oliphant might easily have missed
it in this dim light; but now his task grew harder, for he knew
that, apart from pet-dog whimsies, she loved her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he safe, Mr. Oliphant?&#8221; she asked, bridging all usual
courtesies of greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hale and well. I saw him three days since, and he sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
messages to you, knowing I had errands here in Lancashire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd, easy for the moment because her good man did
not happen to be lying dead among the ditches of her nightmares,
grew almost roguish. &#8220;And his heart, sir? Is it
sound, too? There are so many pretty women in the south&mdash;I
know, because I lived there once, before I came to these
bleak hills that frighten me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant sought for some way of breaking news better left
untold. &#8220;You to fear rivalry?&#8221; he said, in his low, pleasant
voice. &#8220;Sir Jasper has known you all these years&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely. And the years have left their mark. You need
not dwell on that, Mr. Oliphant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant that, to have known you all these years&mdash;why, it
explains the lover-like and pressing messages he sent by me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then Lady Royd was like a girl in her teens. &#8220;Tell me
what he said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, by your leave!&#8221; laughed Oliphant. &#8220;He said so much,
and my time is not my own just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&mdash;how comforting you are, like Mr. Underwood, who
finds always the right word to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say it with a difference, I hope,&#8221; snapped Oliphant, too
weary to hide old dislikes. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known Mr. Underwood
longer than I care to remember. He&#8217;s a man I&#8217;d trust to fail
me whenever the big hunt was up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance laughed suddenly. The relief was so unexpected and
so rousing. &#8220;You&#8217;ve the gift of knowing men, Mr. Oliphant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, child!&#8221; broke in Lady Royd. &#8220;You must come to
my years before you talk of understanding men; and even then,
if I die in my bed at ninety, I shall never know why we find
their daft ways so likeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant, afraid to hurt a woman always, was seeking for
some way to break his news. This wife of Sir Jasper&#8217;s was
leal and tender, underneath her follies; and her husband was
in retreat&mdash;in a retreat dangerous to the safety of his body, but
more perilous still to the quick and fiery soul that had led him
south with Prince Charles Edward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>&#8220;He is in good health,&#8221; he said slowly&mdash;&#8220;but the Cause is
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been a battle?&#8221; She was alert, attentive now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;a battle of the Council-chamber, and the Prince was
outnumbered. The odds were four to one at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor do I,&#8221; he went on, in a quiet heat of rage. &#8220;We were
cavaliers all, dashing straight through England on the forlorn
hope. All depended on looking forward. The chiefs chose
just that moment to look back along the road of prudence. It
is disastrous, pitiful. I dare not think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they&mdash;are in retreat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my message to you. Sir Jasper wishes you to stay
here at Windyhough. The march north will go wide of you,
through Langton, and you&#8217;ll be secure here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd stood very still in the wind that at another time
would have made her peevish with longing for her warm south
country. Her surface tricks, the casual littleness that had disturbed
Sir Jasper&#8217;s peace, were blown aside. She was thinking
of her husband, of all this Rising meant to him, of his
heart-sickness and the hazards that were doubled now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would God, sir, that he had bidden me go out to join him
in retreat,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;I shall be secure here, he thinks?
House walls about one, Mr. Oliphant, and food to eat, and wine
to drink&mdash;are they security? I&#8217;m weak and foolish on the sudden&mdash;I
never understood till now that, where he goes, there is
home for me. Shelter? I need none, except his arms about
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are times&mdash;moments set thick with trouble, when faith
and all else seem drowning in the flood&mdash;that compel us to
struggle free of reticence. Oliphant of Muirhouse was not
aware that there was anything singular or unseemly in this
spoiled wife&#8217;s statement of her case. Nance answered to the
direct appeal; for her own heart was bruised, and fragrant
with the herb named pity. And Rupert, for his part, stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
aside and gazed at his mother across the red, murky twilight,
and wondered how it came that one of his dreams was answered
after all. In face and voice and tender uprightness of
figure, this mother of his was something near the ideal he had
woven round her, despite her careless handling of him in the
years gone by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, there!&#8221; said Lady Royd, with a coquettish, gentle
laugh. &#8220;Nance was talking not long ago of love and knighthood
and all that&mdash;the baby girl!&mdash;and I rapped her over the
knuckles with my fan. It&#8217;s a humdrum world we live in, Mr.
Oliphant; and, by that token, you will come in to supper before
you carry on the news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even a mouthful and a glass of wine out here; as for
coming in to the meal I crave&mdash;why, I dare not do it, by your
leave. Sleep is waiting so near to me, to trip me up in the
middle of my errand.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced at him, with the instinct that is never far from
women to play the temptress. &#8220;You look so tired,&#8221; she said
gently. &#8220;Surely your news will wait? A warm hearth, Mr.
Oliphant, and the meal you need&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said just now that house-walls and food and drink
were of little consequence&mdash;unless you had strong hands about
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re strong of your hands already. And I am
weak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Oliphant, &#8220;passably strong; but it is each man
to his trade, my lady. The hands I need&mdash;they greet me on
the uplands, when my horse and I are so tired out that it is
laughable. We get up into the roomy moors&mdash;our business lies
in that sort of country&mdash;and the curlews go crying, crying, as
if their sorrow could not rest since a Stuart once was martyred.
And we gather up our courage, my horse and I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You men,&#8221; she broke in fretfully&mdash;&#8220;your thoughts run always
up the hills. And you find only the old feuds&mdash;a Stuart
martyred near a hundred years ago, a king who&#8217;s earth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
bone-dust by this time, as we shall be one day. It matters so
little, Mr. Oliphant, when we come to the end of our lives&mdash;to
the end of our singing-time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant of Muirhouse had learned the hardest of life&#8217;s lessons&mdash;a
broad and catholic simplicity; and in the learning he
had gained an added edge to the temper that now was lithe as
steel. &#8220;King Charles is neither earth nor bone-dust,&#8221; he said
pleasantly. &#8220;He is&mdash;alive, my lady, and he knows that we
remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remembrance? What of that?&#8221; asked the other lazily.
&#8220;Just last year&#8217;s rose-leaves, sir, with the faded scent about
them. By your leave, Mr. Oliphant, I thought you more workmanlike
and modern.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Rupert who broke in. &#8220;Remember?&#8221; he said stormily.
&#8220;My father taught me just that word, when he used to
come up into the nursery long ago, and play with us. He did
not know then how&mdash;how like God&#8217;s fool I was to grow up,
and he would tell me tales of Charles the First, how likeable
and kingly he was always; how he&#8217;d have been glad to take his
crown off, and live like a country gentleman, following field-sports
all the day, and coming back to the wife and bairns he
loved, to spend long evenings with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant of Muirhouse felt pity stir about him. This lad&mdash;with
the simplicity of one who was seeing far back along the
years, scarce knowing that he was speaking his thoughts aloud&mdash;was
a figure to rouse any thinking man&#8217;s attention. He was
so good a soldier wasted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then father would tell me,&#8221; went on Rupert, the passion
deepening in his voice, &#8220;how the King was asked to leave it
all; how he could have saved his life, if he had given his Faith
in exchange, and how he would not yield. And then&mdash;father
made it all so plain to me&mdash;the King went out from Whitehall,
one bitter January day, and the scaffold and the streets were
thick with snow, and he went with a grave, happy face, as if he
had many friends about him. And he knelt awhile at the
scaffold in decent prayer; and then he turned to Bishop Juxon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and said, &#8216;Remember!&#8217; And then&mdash;black Cromwell had his
way of him, for a little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, that is past history,&#8221; protested Lady Royd, with
petulant dislike of sorrow. &#8220;Of course he died well, and, to
be sure, the snow must have added to his great discomfort;
but we live in other times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Oliphant, sharp as a bugle-call. &#8220;We live in
the same times, my lady. The way of men&#8217;s hearts does not
change. I&#8217;m tired, and not so young as I was; but your son
has marshalled all my courage up.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then Rupert stood aside. His chivalry and hero-worship,
like his love for Nance, were too delicate as yet, for lack of
drill; and he was ashamed that Oliphant of Muirhouse should
praise his littleness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Oliphant,&#8221; said Lady Royd, with her roguish, faded
laugh, &#8220;you&#8217;re like the rest of my daft men-folk; you are all
for remembrance of the days behind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. We take a few steps back, the better to leap forward.
That is the strict method of leaping any five-barred
gate. There&#8217;s been so much surmise about that riddle of &#8216;Remember,&#8217;
and Rupert here has made it plain to me for the first
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Out of the mouths of babes,&#8217;&#8221; said Rupert&#8217;s mother, with
a flippancy that was born of this long idleness at Windyhough,
the long anxiety for the safety of her husband, whom,
in some muddled way, she loved.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is no babe, by your leave. He is nearly a proven man,
my lady, and I think God finds no better praise than that for
any of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was all quick in the saying, this talk of folk who heard
disaster sing down the bitter wind; but Nance, looking on and
seeking some forward grip of life since Will Underwood had
fallen by the way, was aware that Rupert had sounded the
rally-call when all seemed lost. He was no longer scholarly,
unpractical; from the background, with the murky gloaming
round him, he was a figure dominant among them. And from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
that background he stepped forward, lightly, with self-assurance,
because there was no pageantry about this game of sorrow,
but only the quick need to take hold of the every-day routine
of hardship.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might happen that the retreat came up by way of Windyhough?&#8221;
he asked, straightening the scholarly stoop of his
shoulders.</p>

<p>Oliphant looked gravely at him&mdash;measured him, with an eye
trained to quick judgment of a man&mdash;and dared not lie to this
son of Sir Jasper&#8217;s who stayed here among the women, seeking
better work. &#8220;There&#8217;s no chance of it,&#8221; he said gruffly.
&#8220;They are taking the Langton road. I&mdash;I am sorry, Rupert.
I wish the thick of it were coming this way. You&#8217;re in need
of exercise, my lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Rupert laughed suddenly. &#8220;Mr. Oliphant,&#8221; he said,
with his quiet, disarming humour, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had drill enough&mdash;a
useless sort of drill&mdash;and I&#8217;m praying these days for assault,
and musketry, and siege&mdash;anything to save us stay-at-homes
from sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant looked down at the years of his own misshapen
boyhood, saw himself a weakling, unproven, hidden by the
mists of his own high desires. And he gripped Rupert&#8217;s hand,
said farewell to Lady Royd, and got to saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; asked Rupert, with sharp, disconsolate dismay.
&#8220;Take me with you, sir. There&#8217;s a broken-winded
horse or two still left in stable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I obey orders,&#8221; snapped Oliphant, with brusque command.
&#8220;You will do no less, and Sir Jasper was exact in his wish that
you should guard the women here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert was sick at heart, restless to be in the open, lest faith
and courage were killed outright by these stifled days at Windyhough.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re safe, you tell me,&#8221; he said, yielding to the queer,
gusty temper that few suspected in him. &#8220;Then I&#8217;m free to
breathe again. With you, or without you, I shall join the
Rising at long last.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>Oliphant&#8217;s heart went out to the mettle of this ill-balanced,
stormy lad. For there are many who are keen to follow victory
at the gallop; but Oliphant was a man who knew his
world&mdash;knew it through all its tricks of speech and manner&mdash;and
he had met few who were eager to ride out along the unsung,
unhonoured road where retreat goes slowly through the
mire.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what this retreat means?&#8221; he asked, in the same
sharp tones, as if on parade. &#8220;Sullen men, and sullen roads,
and northeast winds that cut the heart out of a man&#8217;s body?
Hard-bitten soldiers find it devilish hard to follow, Rupert&mdash;and
there are the pipes, too, to reckon with. These daft Highland
bodies will ever go playing &#8216;The Flowers of the Forest,&#8217;
till the pity of it goes up and down the wind, like Rachel seeking
for strayed children. It is all made up of emptiness and
sorrow, I tell you, this road from Derby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should go from worse emptiness and sorrow, here at
Windyhough,&#8221; said Rupert stubbornly. &#8220;I fear house-walls,
Mr. Oliphant, and the foulest road would seem easy-going&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant broke sharply in. This was his own feeling, but
it was not the time to give sympathy to Sir Jasper&#8217;s heir.
&#8220;You come of a soldier-stock, lad. You want to learn soldiery
one day? Well, you&#8217;ll learn it&mdash;I&#8217;ve trust absolute in
that&mdash;and you begin to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go saddle,&#8221; said Rupert, eager to try a second
fall from horse again.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, by your leave!&#8221; snapped Oliphant. &#8220;You&#8217;ll play sentry
here. Your orders are precise. You guard the house and
women, as Sir Jasper bade you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because Sir Jasper knew that no assault would come,&#8221; said
Rupert, with a return of the old heartache. &#8220;You leave me
as you found me, sir&mdash;a toy soldier guarding a house that could
only tempt fools to capture it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant straightened himself, clicked his heels together.
His voice was tired and husky, but precise. &#8220;Your officer
commands. You obey. What else? Men do not question at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
these times.&#8221; Then, with sudden understanding of the man he
had to deal with&mdash;with some remembrance of his own rebellious
and lonely boyhood&mdash;Oliphant stood, rugged and uncompromising,
a lean, hard six-foot-two of manhood. &#8220;To your
post, sentry!&#8221; he said sharply.</p>

<p>And Rupert found his heart leap out to the command. Instinctively&mdash;because
breed shapes us all&mdash;he lost the scholarly
stoop of shoulders, lost his ill-temper and loneliness. He saluted
stiffly. And Oliphant got to horse, and was riding, slowly
forward, when Lady Royd ran to his saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the most dismaying curiosity, Mr. Oliphant,&#8221; she
said, lifting the pretty, faded face that would always keep its
charm. &#8220;It is the woman&#8217;s curse, they tell us. What <i>did</i>
King Charles mean when he said &#8216;Remember&#8217;? We&#8217;ve been
guessing at the riddle for a hundred years or so, and it still
baffles us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant glanced up at the roomy hills, at the red snow-gloaming
that was dying slowly round their crests. &#8220;What
did he mean&mdash;that day he went to death? No words could
tell you. It was something high, and strong, and lasting, like
your moors up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; that could not be. He was so full of courtesy, so
gentle&mdash;so like the warm south-country I left long ago. King
Charles, sir, was never like these hills that frighten me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant looked down at her, with some pity and a great
chivalry. &#8220;You hold the woman&#8217;s view of him,&#8221; he said, with
the simplicity inborn in him. &#8220;As a man sees him, Lady Royd,
he did what few among us could. His wife and bairns were
pulling him back from the scaffold&mdash;and he loved them; his
ease, his love of life, his fear of the unknown&mdash;all were against
him. He could have saved the most comely head in England,
and would not, because his faith was stubborn. By your leave,
I bow my head when the thought of Martyred Charles goes by
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd looked at this man, so hard of body, so tired and
resolute. &#8220;I thought you practical, Mr. Oliphant.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>&#8220;None more so. I&#8217;m a Scotsman,&#8221; he put in, with a laugh
that struck no discordant note. &#8220;If it had not been for King
Charles, I should not be here&mdash;riding evil roads as if I danced
a pleasant measure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re beyond me, sir; but then, men always were. They
never seem to rest; and when the wind blows keenest, they run
out into it, as if it were warmer than the fireside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there the secret&#8217;s out. That was King Charles&#8217;s meaning
when he bade all Christian royalists remember. It was
your son who explained it all to me just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Rupert! The poor boy dreams too much. You&#8217;re indulgent,
Mr. Oliphant.&#8221;</p>

<p>They fell silent, as people do when feeling throbs and stirs
about them like thunder that is brewing up, but will not break.
And Oliphant, out of this thunder-weather that he knew by
heart, found sudden intuition. Sir Jasper&#8217;s wife had not followed
him to learn what the last message meant of a King dead
these hundred years; she had sought cover, as women do when
they are harassed, had waited till she found courage to ask the
question that was nearest to her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re thinking of your husband, Lady Royd?&#8221; he said,
with blunt assurance. &#8220;I shall see him soon, if all goes well,
and I shall tell him&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Women undoubtedly are as Heaven made them, a mystery
past man&#8217;s understanding. Lady Royd, deep in her trouble,
chose this moment to remember how Sir Jasper had wooed
her as a girl&mdash;chose to grow younger on the sudden, to carry
that air of buoyancy and happiness which makes the tired
world welcome all daft lovers. &#8220;You&#8217;ve read my heart, sir,
in some odd way. My husband&mdash;I cannot tell you what he
means to me. I was not bred to soldiery. I&mdash;I hated the
sword he carried out with him, because sharp steel has always
been a nightmare to me, and he was cruel when he bade me
buckle it on for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As God sees us, he was kind,&#8221; broke in Oliphant, moved
by extreme pity for this spoiled wife who had fallen on evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
days. &#8220;He loves you. The summons came. It was for
your sake&mdash;yours, do you not understand?&mdash;that he kept faith
with the Prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For my sake&mdash;he could have stayed at home. I&mdash;I needed
him. I told him so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant was so tired that even compassion could not
soften the rough edge of his temper. &#8220;And if he&#8217;d
stayed? You would have liked your tame cat about the
house? You&#8217;d have fussed over him and petted him&mdash;but
you&#8217;d never in this life have found the medicine to cure his
shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there!&#8221; said the other fretfully. &#8220;You worship
honour. It is always honour with you men who need excuse
for riding far away from home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honour?&#8221; snapped Oliphant, eager again for the relief
of miry roads and saddle-soreness. &#8220;It is the Prince&#8217;s
watchword. His heart is broken&mdash;or near to it&mdash;and honour
is the one light left him. It keeps him gay, my lady, through
fouler trouble than you or I have strength to face. And so&mdash;good-night,
I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! We must not part like this. I&mdash;I am so foolish,
Mr. Oliphant&mdash;and you are angry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon,&#8221; he said, with quick and gay compunction.
&#8220;It was my temper&mdash;my accursed temper. I&#8217;m too tired just
now to keep a tight rein on the jade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, there! You were always generous. It is a quality
that keeps men lean, I notice.&#8221; She looked him up and down,
again with the hint of coquetry that became her well. &#8220;It
is a gallant sort of leanness, after all. For myself, I&#8217;m
growing&mdash;a little plump, shall we say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More graceful in the outline than myself. I was always
a figure to scare corbie-crows away with.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper&#8217;s wife, from the depth of her own trouble, knew
how weary and in need of solitude he was. She wondered
that he could keep up this game of ball&mdash;nice coquetry and
chiselled answer&mdash;when all the sky was red about the moor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
up yonder, and all the hazard of retreat was singing at their
ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will see my husband soon?&#8221; she said softly. &#8220;I&mdash;I
have a message for him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My trade lies that way. You can trust me with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may tell him that I&mdash;I miss him, sir; and if he seems
to miss me, too&mdash;why, go so far as to say that my heart is
aching.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant, moved by a gust of feeling, stooped to her hand.
&#8220;I never had a wife, myself. God was not kind that way.
I&#8217;ll take your message, and Sir Jasper will forget the miry
roads, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rode out, a trim, square-shouldered figure, carrying
hardship as a man should. And Lady Royd, because he reminded
her of the husband whose memory was very fragrant
now, went down to the gate, and watched horse and rider
merge into the gloaming. And, long after they were out of
sight, she stood and listened to the tip-tap of hoofs, faint and
ever fainter, down and up the track that was taking Oliphant
along his road of every-day, hard business.</p>

<p>Behind her, Rupert and Nance Demaine were standing, facing
each other with mute dismay. Without knowing that
they were eavesdroppers, they had heard Lady Royd&#8217;s voice,
with its half-pleasant note of querulousness, and the rider&#8217;s
low, tired answers to her questions. And they had not heeded
overmuch&mdash;for each was busy with the ill news brought from
Derby&mdash;until, merciless, exact, they heard across the courtyard
Oliphant&#8217;s rough, &#8220;And if he&#8217;d stayed? You would
have liked your tame cat about the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance had looked sharply up at Rupert, had seen his
soldierly, straight air desert him, and she understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, broken up by sharp sympathy, &#8220;he&mdash;he
did not mean that you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you, too, fit the fool&#8217;s cap on? I&#8217;m going indoors,
Nance&mdash;to my post, to find Simon Foster.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was hard hit; and the strength of the fathers stiffened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
his courage, now in the hour of shame, so that he was almost
gay. And Nance could make nothing of this mood of his,
because she was born a woman, and he a man.</p>

<p>&#8220;You always brought your troubles to me, Rupert,&#8221; she
pleaded, laying a hand on his sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, till they grew too big for you. And now&mdash;why,
Nance, I think I&#8217;ll shoulder them myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to stand far away, not needing her. It seemed,
rather, in this moment of despair, that she went in need of
him. Will Underwood had deserted her, had trodden her
first love underfoot; she was bruised and tired; and the Rising
news was wintry as her loneliness.</p>

<p>Rupert, his voice firm again, turned at the porch. &#8220;Good-night,
Nance,&#8221; he said, with the gaiety that hurt her. &#8220;You
may sleep well&mdash;the tame cat guards the house, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was bitterness and heartache about this house of
Windyhough. The wind would not be still, and men&#8217;s sorrows
would not rest. And the stark moor above lay naked
to the wintry moon, and shivered underneath her coverlet of
sleet.</p>

<p>Nance, by and by, followed Rupert indoors, and went into
the parlour, with its scent of last year&#8217;s rose-leaves, its pretty,
useless ornaments, its air of stifled luxury, warring with the
ruddy gloaming light that strode down from the moors and
peeped through every window, as if to spy out the shams
within doors.</p>

<p>She sat down to the spinet, and touched a mellow, tender
chord or two; and then, because needs must, she found relief
in song. Her singing voice was like herself, dainty, well-found,
full of deep cadences where tenderness and laughter
lurked. It was no voice to take the town by storm, but one
to hearten men, when they came in from the open, against
the next day&#8217;s warfare. And she sang Stuart songs, with
a little lilt of sorrow in them, because of Oliphant&#8217;s news
from Derby and because of Will Underwood&#8217;s sadder retreat
from honour, and hoped somehow that Rupert would hear her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and come to her, because she needed him. He was so fond
of ballads&mdash;those, most of all, that had the Stuart constancy
about them&mdash;and Nance was sure that she could entice him
down, could sing some little of his evil mood away from him.</p>

<p>Instead, as she halted with her fingers on the keys, she
heard Rupert tramping overhead, and Simon Foster&#8217;s heavy
footfall, as they went their round of what, in irony and bitterness,
they named the defences.</p>

<p>&#8220;This loophole covers the main door, Simon,&#8221; she heard
Rupert say, with his tired laugh. &#8220;In case of a direct attack
from the front, I station myself here with six muskets,
aim sure and quickly, picking my man carefully each time,
and disorder them by making them think we are in force.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, master,&#8221; growled Simon. &#8220;And while you&#8217;re
busy that way, I make round to the left wing, and get a few
shots in from there across the courtyard. Oh, dangment!&#8221;
he broke off. &#8220;We have it all by heart, and there&#8217;s only one
thing wanting&mdash;the attack itself. I&#8217;m nigh wearied o&#8217; this
bairn&#8217;s play, I own. It puts me i&#8217; mind, it does, of Huntercomb
Fair, last October as ever was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened there?&#8221; asked Rupert, as if the other&#8217;s
slow, unhurried humour were a welcome respite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they were playing a terrible fine piece where soldiers
kept coming in, and crossing th&#8217; stage, till you counted &#8217;em
by scores. But, after I&#8217;d seen what was to be seen, I went
out; and I happened to go round by the back o&#8217; the booth, and
I saw how it was done. There were just five soldiers, master&mdash;one
was Thomas Scatterty&#8217;s lad, I noticed, who&#8217;s said
to run away from a sheep if it bleats at him&mdash;and these
durned five, why, they went in at one end o&#8217; the booth, and
marched across th&#8217; stage, and out a t&#8217;other end. Then they
ran round at th&#8217; back, and in again; and so it went on, like,
till th&#8217; sweat fair dripped from them, what with hurrying in
and out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance, listening idly, could hear that low, recurrent laugh
of Rupert&#8217;s&mdash;the laugh that was tired, and hid many troubles.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, Simon, yes,&#8221; he said, with high disdain of himself
and circumstance, &#8220;it is all very like Huntercomb Fair; but
at Huntercomb they had the jostling crowd, the lights, the
screech of the fiddles. Here at Windyhough we have&mdash;just
silence&mdash;a silence so thick and damnable, Simon, that I&#8217;m
praying for a gale, and fallen chimney-stacks, and the wind
piping through the broken windows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, you were ever a dreamer. The dreamers are all for
speed, and earthquakes, and sudden happenings. Life as it&#8217;s
lived, master, doesn&#8217;t often gallop. It creeps along, like, same
as ye and me are doing, and keeps itself alive for fear of
starving, and gets up, some durned way or another, for th&#8217;
next day&#8217;s work. Well, have we done, like, or must we finish
this lad&#8217;s game?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Nance heard a sharper note in Rupert&#8217;s voice.
She had heard it once before, that day he fought with his
brother on the moor because he thought her honour was in
question. &#8220;We finish, Simon. What else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re at your faith again, master. I can hear it
singing like a throstle. Well, I&#8217;m a plain man myself, asking
plain proof. Just as man to man&mdash;and want o&#8217; respect
apart&mdash;has your pretty, gentleman&#8217;s faith done much for
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Rupert, unexpectedly. &#8220;It has given me pluck
to see this business through. A houseful of women and
cripples&mdash;my father taking all the burden on his shoulders
while I skulk at home&mdash;dear God! I&#8217;d be in a coward&#8217;s
grave by now, Simon, if faith had not stood by me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s summat in it, after all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is powder in the musket,&#8221; said Rupert, as if there could
be no further argument. &#8220;No more, no less. But you and
I, Simon, have to find the spark that fires it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance heard them pass overhead, heard the sound of
Simon&#8217;s heavy boots die along the corridor. And she turned
again to the spinet, and her fingers moved up and down the
keys, their colour mellowed by long service, and played random<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
melodies that were in keeping with her thoughts&mdash;not
Stuart airs, because these asked always sacrifice, and the big
heart, and the royal laugh that comes when things go wrong
in this world.</p>

<p>Nance was too tired to-night for the adventurous road.
To-morrow she would be herself again, eager, resolute, prepared
for the day&#8217;s journey. But just now she needed the
sleep, that stood far away from her; needed some charitable,
firm voice to tell her she was foolish and unstrung; needed
Rupert, as she had not guessed that she could lack any man.
And Rupert had tramped overhead, concerned with make-believe
defences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he does not care!&#8221; she said, believing that she hated
him. &#8220;Simon Foster, crippled in both legs, and musty loopholes,
and powder that he&#8217;ll never use&mdash;they&#8217;re more to him
than all this heartbreak gathering over Windyhough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Into the scented room, with its candles shining from their
silver sconces, Lady Royd came, tremulous and white of face,
from watching Oliphant of Muirhouse ride out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nance, my dear, I&mdash;I am tired,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we all are,&#8221; Nance answered, rising from the
spinet with a deference that had no heart in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re querulous, and so am I,&#8221; said the other, with
a shrewd glance at the girl&#8217;s face. &#8220;If our men could see
us now&mdash;our men who fight for us&mdash;they would be astonished,
Nance. We&#8217;re so little like their dreams of us. You
in a bad temper, and I ready to cry if a mouse threatened
me, and our men, God bless them! thinking only of old England,
and our beautiful bright eyes, Nance&mdash;your eyes and
mine&mdash;just red, my dear, if you&#8217;ll forgive me, with the tears
men think our luxury.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance, made up of hill-rides, and free winds, and charity,
looked quietly at Lady Royd, read some fellowship in the
pretty, faded face. &#8220;I have&mdash;a few griefs of my own,&#8221; she
said, with the sudden penitence that was always like April&#8217;s
sunshine after rain. &#8220;I forgot that you had yours.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>The older woman grasped Nance&#8217;s hand, and held it, and
looked into the young, faithful eyes. She needed youth just
now; for she felt that she was growing old.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nance, he is out with the Rising. And they&#8217;ve retreated.
And&mdash;and, girl, when you come to my age, and have a husband
and a son who will go fighting for high causes&mdash;oh,
you&#8217;ll know, Nance, how one&#8217;s heart aches till it goes near to
breaking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will tell me,&#8221; said Nance, laying a gentle hand on
the other&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>And Lady Royd looked gravely at her for a moment,
through the tears that lay thick about the babyish, blue eyes.
And then she laughed&mdash;with gallantry and tiredness, as Rupert
had laughed not long ago when he listened to Simon
Foster&#8217;s tale of Huntercomb Fair.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, I should be glad to tell you&mdash;if I could. How
should I find words? I&#8217;ve loved him for more than six-and-twenty
years, Nance, and guessed as much long since, but was
never sure of it till he rode out. And now&mdash;he&#8217;s in the thick
of danger, and I cannot go to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is happy,&#8221; said Nance, with stormy wish to help this
woman, stormy grasp of the courage taught her by the hills.
&#8220;Our men are bred that way; they are happiest when they&#8217;re
like to lose their necks&mdash;in the hunting-field, or on Tower
Hill, or wherever the good God wills. I think Sir Jasper is
happier than you or I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true.&#8221; Lady Royd made the most of her slender
height. She was learning the way of royalty at last, after
Sir Jasper had tried patiently to teach it to her all these
years. &#8220;And I? My heart is breaking, Nance; but I&#8217;ll
carry my wounds as&mdash;as he would carry his. They&#8217;re in retreat,
I tell you, and&mdash;and we shall not meet again, I think&mdash;I,
and the husband whom I love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you will meet&mdash;and&mdash;and, if not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; said Nance,
with that nice handling of high faith and common sense which
made her charm so human and so likeable&mdash;&#8220;you love him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and his one thought is for you; and Rupert would tell you
that death is so little, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it is,&#8221; said Lady Royd, with a petulant shrug
of the shoulders; &#8220;but it is tiresome of you, Nance, to remind
one of the end of all things pleasant. Oh, by your leave, my
dear, no talk of faith! I&#8217;ve had no other food to live on
these last months, and I need a change of diet, girl, need&mdash;just
my man&#8217;s arms about me, and his voice bidding me take
heart again. I tell you, we&#8217;re not strong, we women, without
our men to help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance remembered her liking for Will Underwood, the
shameful end of it; remembered Rupert, tramping overhead
not long ago with Simon Foster and disdaining all the songs
that should have brought him to her side. And her grasp of
life grew firmer on the sudden. It was true, as spoiled, wayward
Lady Royd had said, that women, since the world&#8217;s beginning,
need the strong arms of their men about them.</p>

<p>Simon Foster, meanwhile, had done his round of the house,
had said good-night to Rupert; and afterwards he had gone
down to the kitchens, his step like a lover&#8217;s. He did not find
Martha there, and answered the sly banter of the women-servants
by saying that he needed to cross to the mistals, to
see how the roan cow, that was sick of milk-fever, was
faring.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find Martha there,&#8221; said a pert scullery-maid; &#8220;and
I&#8217;m sorry for the roan cow, Simon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221; asked Simon, tired long since of all women
except one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you alone&mdash;or Martha alone&mdash;you&#8217;re kindly with all
ailments. But, put the two o&#8217; you together&mdash;within kissing
distance&mdash;and the roan cow must learn to bellow if she needs
be heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simon Foster turned about. He was the lone man fighting
for his liberty. &#8220;I&#8217;m fair blanketed with women these days,&#8221;
he growled. &#8220;Their lile, daft ways go meeting a plain man at
every turning of the stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>&#8220;One maid&#8217;s lile, daft ways have sent your wits astray,
Simon,&#8221; purred his adversary.</p>

<p>Simon straightened his bent shoulders. The young light
was in his eyes again. He looked comely; for a man at bay
shows always the qualities that are hidden by sleek prosperity.
&#8220;Well, yes,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but Martha happens to be worth
twenty of you silly kitchen wenches&mdash;that&#8217;s why I chose her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pert maid took up a clout from the table, aimed it at
Simon, and missed him by three feet or so.</p>

<p>&#8220;The master could teach you a lesson,&#8221; he chuckled.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve been up the pastures these days, shooting. And
master has got a bee in his bonnet, like, about this gunshot
business. &#8216;Simon,&#8217; he says to me, no further back than yesterday,
&#8216;there&#8217;s nothing matters, except to see straight and
to aim straight. We may be needed by and by.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was so that Simon got away, and went out a conqueror
for his little moment, because he had silenced the strife of
women&#8217;s tongues. Across the darkness of the mistal-yard
a lanthorn came glimmering fitfully, as Martha crossed from
the byres to the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Martha?&#8221; said Foster, striding into the flickering
belt of light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Simon?&#8221; she answered, without surprise. She was
no lass in her teens, to think that grown men welcome fright;
and so she did not scream, sudden as his intrusion was.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking, lass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so have I. The roan cow is easier, thanks to me;
and all the while I put the salt-bags on, and cosseted her,
and teased her back to health, I thought a deal, Simon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, of me?&#8221; he asked, with a sprightly air.</p>

<p>An owl, far down the sloping fields, sounded her call as
she swooped to kill rats and field-mice for her larder. And
Martha, though the light from her lanthorn was dim enough
to hide it, could not forego a touch of coquetry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of you?&#8221; she laughed, setting a finger to her dimpled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
cheek. &#8220;Hark to yond owl. You&#8217;re all alike, you hunting-folk;
you&#8217;ve the masterful, sharp voice with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems somebody has got to be masterful these days. I&#8217;ve
driven sheep to market, and I&#8217;ve tried to drive pigs, and I&#8217;ve
handled skew-tempered horses; but for sheer, daft contrariness,
give me a houseful o&#8217; women, with few men to guide
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not liking women these days?&#8221; said Martha
tartly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, by ones or twos. It&#8217;s when they swarm about a
house, like a hive o&#8217; bees, that lone men get feared, like, o&#8217;
your indoor fooleries. Anyway, Martha, I wish I were out
with Sir Jasper&mdash;just as Master Rupert does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you talked of&mdash;of liking me&mdash;not so very long since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, and meant it; but how&#8217;s a man to find speech wi&#8217;
the one lass he wants, when yard and kitchen&#8217;s filled wi&#8217;
women he&#8217;s never a need for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s how I feel,&#8221; said Martha, unexpectedly.
&#8220;Women are made that way, Simon; they&#8217;re silly when they
herd too thick together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s like to be a change before so very long,&#8221; put in
the other hurriedly, as if he talked of the next day&#8217;s ride to
market. &#8220;It seems this bonnie Prince they make such a
crack of has turned back from Derby. And we&#8217;re near the
line they&#8217;ll take, Martha; and, please God, there&#8217;s a chance
the fight will come Windyhough way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll be killed, Simon?&#8221; she said, coming so close
to him that the horn-top of her lantern scorched his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not. There&#8217;s two sides go to a killing, same as to
a bargain. It might happen, like, that t&#8217;other lad went
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what of me, Simon, if&mdash;if it chanced otherwise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not meaning to let it chance otherwise, my lass.
I&#8217;ve you to think of these days.&#8221; And then he drew apart,
after the fashion of men when war is in the air. &#8220;Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Rupert shapes gradely,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I always said he had
the makings of a soldier in him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s a scholar,&#8221; said Martha. &#8220;I like him well
enough&mdash;we all do&mdash;but he wears his head i&#8217; the clouds,
Simon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuts! He&#8217;s never had his chance. You&#8217;re all for young
Master Maurice; he&#8217;s stronger and more showy, as second
bairns are apt to be; but gi&#8217;e me the young master&#8217;s settled
pluck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gi&#8217;e me,&#8221; said Martha, with bewildering tenderness, &#8220;the
end of all this Rising trouble, and us two in a farm together,
wi&#8217; a churn to work at, and an inglenook to sit by when the
day&#8217;s work is over wi&#8217;. I&#8217;d not sell that farm I&#8217;ve dreamed
of, Simon, for all your bonnie Prince&#8217;s love-locks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as for love-locks,&#8221; said the other, his thoughts still
busier with war than peace, &#8220;he has none so many left these
days. He&#8217;s a plain man, riding troubled roads; and he carries
himself like a man, they say, or near thereby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martha lifted her lanthorn suddenly to his face. &#8220;Aye,
you carry the &#8216;far&#8217; look,&#8221; she said jealously. &#8220;Cattle i&#8217; the
byre, the quiet lowing o&#8217; them, and a hearth-place warm and
ready for ye&mdash;they&#8217;re windle-straws to ye just now, my lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Simon laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;d like one straight-up fight, I
own, before I settle down. It&#8217;s i&#8217; the blood, ye see. I carried
a pike i&#8217; the last Rising, and killed one here and there,
and took my wounds. A man no way forgets, Martha, the
young, pleasant days. And there&#8217;s danger near the house, if
all Mr. Oliphant said be true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, gang in and meet it, then,&#8221; snapped Martha, &#8220;if
your stiffened joints will let you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was sore with jealousy, though Simon&#8217;s battle-hunger
was her only rival, and struck at random, cruelly, as women
do at these times, because God made them so. And Simon,
because men are made so, winced, and recovered, and said
never a word as he crossed to the kitchen door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simon!&#8221; she called, with late-found penitence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>He did not turn his head, but strode indoors, through the
running banter that met him by the way, and went upstairs to
find Rupert standing by the loophole that overlooked the main
doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;At your post, master?&#8221; he said dryly.</p>

<p>Rupert turned sharply. &#8220;You disturbed a dream of mine,&#8221;
he said, in his well-bred, scholarly voice. &#8220;I was fancying
men were out in the moonlit courtyard, that I aimed straight,
Simon, and shot a few of those black rats from Hanover.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simon chuckled soberly. He liked to hear his favourite
lapse from the orderly speech that was his usual habit.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll come, sure enough,&#8221; he said gruffly. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
waited over-long, you and me, to miss some chance o&#8217; frolic
at the last.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert, with his large, royal air, disdaining always the lean,
scholarly form he carried, laughed gently. &#8220;My faith is
weak to-night, Simon. So little happens, and God knows I&#8217;ve
prayed for open battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, bide,&#8221; said Simon. &#8220;I&#8217;ve my own fancy, too,
though I was never what you might call a prayerful man, that
the battle&#8217;s coming up this way. My old wounds are plaguing
me, master, like to burn me up; and you may say it&#8217;s th&#8217;
change i&#8217; the weather, if it pleases ye, but I think different.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert welcomed the other&#8217;s guarded prophecy, for to-night
he needed hope. And he fell again to looking through
the loophole on to the empty, moonlit courtyard; and suddenly,
from the far side of the house, he heard Nance&#8217;s voice
again, as she tried to sing a little of Lady Royd&#8217;s heart-sickness
away.</p>

<p>The voice, so low and strong and charitable, the thought
of her face, her brown, waving hair, her candid eyes, struck
Rupert with intolerable pain and sense of loss. He recalled
the years when he should have been up and doing, winning his
spurs like other men. His shy, half-ironic, half-scholarly
aloofness from the life of every day showed as a thing contemptible.
He magnified his shortcomings, accused himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of cowardice, not physical cowardice, but moral. All these
years, while his love for Nance was growing, he should have
been conquering the weakness that separated him from his
fellows, should have been climbing the steep path of hardship,
training himself to be strong as his passion for Nance
Demaine.</p>

<p>To-night, as he thought of these things, he understood,
to the last depth, this love that possessed him utterly. It was
a soldier&#8217;s love, a strong man&#8217;s. It was content to forego,
content to watch and guard and work, so long as Nance was
happy, though to himself it brought tumult and unrest
enough. The keen, man&#8217;s longing to claim her for his own,
to take her out of reach of such as Will Underwood, had
given him many an evil day and night; but through it all,
unconquerable, had come that strong, chivalrous desire to keep
her feet from the puddles and the mire of life, to serve her
hand and foot, and afterwards, since he was needful to her
in no other way, to stand by and watch her happiness from
some shadowed corner.</p>

<p>There was all his life&#8217;s training, all the tenor of his long,
boyhood&#8217;s thoughts, in this fine regard he brought Squire
Demaine&#8217;s daughter. There was, too, the Stuart training
that had deepened the old Royd instincts given him at birth.
It was, in part, the devotion he would have given a queen
if he had been her cavalier; and, through it all, there went
that silver skein of haplessness and abnegation bravely borne
which is in the woof and weft of all things Stuart. He knew
the unalterable strength and beauty of his love; and, with a
sudden overmastering shame, he saw himself&mdash;himself, unfit
to join the Rising, useless and a stay-at-home, beside this
other picture of his high, chivalrous regard for Nance. He
laughed bitterly. It was grotesque, surely, that so fine a passion
should be in charge of such a weakling.</p>

<p>And then, from the midst of his humiliation and pain, he
plucked courage and new hope. It was his way, as it had been
his father&#8217;s. If this dream of his came true&mdash;if the retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
swept up this way, as Simon hoped, and gave work into his
hands&mdash;he would give Nance deeds at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;The night is not so empty as it was, Simon,&#8221; he said,
turning sharply. &#8220;We&#8217;ll patrol the house.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE GALLOP</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> retreat had moved up through Staffordshire and
Cheshire, always evading the pursuit that followed it so
closely from many separate quarters. The Highlanders had
ever their hearts turned backward to the London road&mdash;the
road of battle; but old habit made their feet move briskly
along the route mapped out for them. They set the pace for
the Lowland foot, less used to the swinging stride that was
half a run; and for this reason the Prince&#8217;s army went northward
at a speed incredible to Marshal Wade, the Duke of
Cumberland, and other heavy-minded generals who were
eager in pursuit.</p>

<p>There was irony in the whole sad business. A few cautious
leaders of the clans apart, few men were anxious to
succeed in this retreat. They would have welcomed any
hindrance by the way that allowed one or more of the pursuing
armies to come up with them. Food was often lacking,
because defeated folk are apt to find less wayside hospitality
than conquerors; their feet were sore from long contact
with the wet roads, that both chafed and softened them;
yet their worst hardship was the need for battle that found no
food to thrive on. Behind them Cumberland was cursing his
luck because he could not catch them up; yet, had he known
it, he was the gainer by his failure. If he and his mixed company
of hirelings had met the Prince&#8217;s men just now, they
would have been ridden through and through, as Colonel
Gardiner&#8217;s men had been at Prestonpans in the first battle of
the Rising. For the Highlander is sad and gusty as the mist-topped
hills that cradled him; but when the mood is on him,
when all seems lost, and he is gay because the odds are ludicrously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
against him, he goes bare-sark to the fight and accomplishes
what more stolid men name miracles.</p>

<p>They went north&mdash;the men who wished to overtake and the
men who yearned to be overtaken. And the luck was all with
Marshal Wade and Cumberland, for the Prince&#8217;s army constantly
evaded them. There are times, maybe, when God
proves His gentlemen by the road of sick retreat, by denial
of the fight they seek. But few win through this sort of
hazard.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper was leading his own little troop of gentry, yeomen,
and farmer-folk when they crossed the Cheshire border
and made up into Lancashire, and neared the bluff heights
that were his homeland. The wind was shrewd still from the
northeast, and sleet was driving from the grey-black mist that
swept the hilltops, yet Sir Jasper, by the look of the shrouded
hills, by the smell of the wind in his teeth, knew that he was
home again in Lancashire. Love of women is a hazardous
and restless enterprise, and a man&#8217;s leal liking for his friend
is apt to be upset by jealousies; but love of the hills that cannot
lie, love of the feel and scents and sounds of the country
that he loves never desert the native-born. They are there,
like a trusty dog, running eagerly before him when he is home
again, biding on the threshold with a welcome if he chances
to be absent.</p>

<p>Until now Sir Jasper had been much with his men, had lightened
their spirits as best he could through this evil march
toward reinforcements in which few believed. But now
some wildness seemed to come to him from the windy moors
that had bred him. He was tired of leading men against the
emptiness that met them day by day, and remembered the
lonely figure of his Prince, who was still obstinate, despite
Captain Goldstein&#8217;s late attack, in riding often behind the rear-guard
of his army. More than once, since leaving Derby,
Sir Jasper had ridden back along the route, had found the
Prince separated by a few hundred yards from the last of the
stragglers, and had tarried with him, partly to be near if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
danger which he seemed to court recurred, and partly because
the close and friendly intimacy that was growing between
them had a charm that lightened the trouble of the road.</p>

<p>To-day, as they came nearer still to his own country&mdash;the
march was planned to reach Langton by nightfall&mdash;Sir Jasper
yielded to his restless mood. He turned to Maurice, who was
riding at his bridle hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take our men forward, boy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll join you by
and by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice showed few traces of the high spirits that had
set him galloping once after Nance Demaine in a race for
the glove she was to forfeit if he caught her up, of the fiery
eagerness with which he had fought his brother Rupert on the
moor. He could not understand the reason of his turn about
from Derby. Since childhood he had been used to find action
ready to his hand, used to the open life of the fields, in saddle
or with a gun under his arm; and he was baffled by this slow,
rain-sodden tramp over roads that led only to the next night&#8217;s
bivouac. The constant rains, moreover, had increased his
saddle-soreness and had given him a maddening toothache;
and it is hard, at two-and-twenty, to bear any pain of body,
apart from that associated with heroic wounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take them forward, sir,&#8221; he answered moodily,
&#8220;though I&#8217;ve no gift of heartening them, as you have. If
you promised me all Lancashire, I could not crack a jest with
them just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper turned his head sharply, glanced at Maurice
with the shrewd, steady eyes of middle age. &#8220;You were not
out in the &#8217;15 Rising, lad,&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;I was through it&mdash;and
thirty years have gone under the bridge since then&mdash;and
I&#8217;ve learned to wait. Waiting trains a man, I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waiting has given me the most devilish toothache, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>And his father laughed. So had he felt himself when,
long ago, an untried boy, he had shared the troubles of a disastrous
Rising. &#8220;There&#8217;s a worse malady,&#8221; he said dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;None that I can think of at this moment.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>&#8220;Try heartache, Maurice&mdash;the Prince can tell you what
that means. And I can tell you, maybe. It comes to older
men, like gout. For the rest, you take your orders. You&#8217;re
in command of our Lancashire lads till I return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice answered, not the words but the quiet hardihood
of this father who had licked him into some semblance of a
man. &#8220;I&#8217;m in charge, sir&mdash;till you return,&#8221; he answered
gravely.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper drew apart, to the edge of the rising, heathery
bank that flanked the road; and he watched the horsemen and
the foot go by. Highlanders passed him with bowed shoulders,
moving like dullards who have forgotten hope; for they
had the temperament which does high deeds to set the world&#8217;s
songs aflame, or which refuses hope of any sort. The Lowlanders
wore a grim and silent air, carrying disillusion with
dourness and reserve. But grief was manifest in every
face.</p>

<p>Whether he died soon or late, Sir Jasper would not forget
this long pageant of despair that went by him along the sodden
northward tracks. Five thousand men, with souls keen
and eager, had been ready for the fight; and they were marching
north unsatisfied. Sir Jasper by habit, was careful of
his tongue; but now he cursed Lord George Murray with
quiet and resolute exactness. The wind was cold, and the
sleet nipped his face; but the chilliest thing that he had met
in life was this surrender of leal folk to such a man as Murray.
It was unbelievable, and he was compelled to take a
new, firmer grip of the faith which had heartened him through
lesser storms.</p>

<p>The last of the army passed, and Sir Jasper sighed sharply
as he reined his horse toward the south and looked for the
one figure&mdash;the figure prominent among them all&mdash;that had
been missing. And presently a solitary horseman came round
the bend of the highway. He carried his shoulders square,
his head erect; yet, under his royal disdain of circumstances,
there was the Stuart sadness plainly marked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>The Prince glanced up as he saw the other ride to meet
him. &#8220;Ah! you, Sir Jasper,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;You
were ever of my mind&mdash;to be where our soldiers need us
most.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You give me too much praise,&#8221; began Sir Jasper, and
could get no farther.</p>

<p>The Prince and he were alone on this barren road&mdash;alone
in the world, it seemed, comrades in the bitter sleet-time of
adversity&mdash;and he was shaken by a sudden, desperate pity,
by a loyalty toward this royal fugitive and a gladness that he
was privileged to share a moment of defeat with him. He
knew, to a heart-beat, what the other was suffering. They
had the like aims, the like hardihood; and intuition taught
them to be brothers, the older man and the young, here on
the northern road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness, I have&mdash;I have no words,&#8221; he said at
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, there!&#8221; said the Prince, with a gentleness that was
cousin to abiding sorrow. &#8220;I know what you would say.
Best leave it unsaid.&#8221;</p>

<p>They jogged up the road together in silence, each busy with
thoughts that were the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is incredible,&#8221; growled Sir Jasper presently, as if the
words escaped him unawares.</p>

<p>The Prince shrugged his shoulders, with a touch of the
French habit that still clung to him. &#8220;But so is life, my
friend&mdash;each day of it the most astounding muddle of surprises.
They said I could not land in Scotland and bring an
ill-trained army through the heart of England. I did it,
by grace of God. And then we said that the road from
Derby to the throne was open to us&mdash;and so it was, but for
one obstacle we had forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness,&#8221; said the other, with sharp remembrance
of the past, &#8220;I could have removed that obstacle&mdash;and would
not. I did not serve you well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! removed the Highlanders&#8217; gospel that they serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
their own chieftain first and after that their king? With
faith you might do it, sir&mdash;the faith that removes mountains;
but otherwise&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had my lord Murray&#8217;s life at command&mdash;and&mdash;I did not
take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince&#8217;s face was hard when he heard the way of that
duel in the wood. He was thinking not at all of pity and
chivalrous scruples, but of the men entrusted to his care who
had been routed by Murray&#8217;s prudent obstinacy. &#8220;God forgive
you, sir!&#8221; he said gravely. &#8220;I wish you had not told
me this. With Murray laid aside I should have had my way
at Derby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper peeped now behind the veil of that disastrous
Council, guessed how disordered the party of retreat would
have been without their leader. And he glanced at the
Prince&#8217;s face&mdash;he who loved and had followed him into the
unknown for sake of warm, unquestioning loyalty&mdash;and read
only condemnation there. And because he was wearier than
he knew, it seemed that all his strength and steadfastness
were leaving him. Until now the cold and hardship had
touched his body, but not the soul of him&mdash;the soul that passed
sorrows through the mills of faith, and made forward battle-songs
of them.</p>

<p>His comrade in adversity glanced round on him suddenly,
saw how hardly he was taking the rebuke. And the Prince,
as his habit was, forgot the bitter might-have-beens and rallied
to the help of one in need.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Jasper,&#8221; he said, with a grace boyish in its candour,
&#8220;we&#8217;re bred of the same stuff, you and I. We are hot and
keen, and we hate&mdash;as far as the gallows, but not as far as
the rope. It seems idle that one Stuart should chide another
of the breed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I served you ill,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;He was known already
as the weak link of the chain&mdash;and I did not snap it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have lain on your conscience. You could not
do it, that was all.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>&#8220;You are kind,&#8221; said Sir Jasper slowly&mdash;&#8220;but you struck
deep just now. I&#8217;ve feared many things in my time, but
never once that I should fail the Stuart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince fumbled in the tail pocket of his riding-coat,
took out a battered pipe, filled and lit it&mdash;with some difficulty,
for the tinder in his box was none too dry. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found
three good things in my travels,&#8221; he said, blowing clouds of
smoke about him&mdash;&#8220;a dog, a pipeful of tobacco, and friends
like yourself, Sir Jasper; they seldom fail a man. I was hasty
just now, for I was thinking of&mdash;of my Highlanders, God
help them!&#8221;</p>

<p>And again a silence fell between them as they rode up and
down the winding road that lay now a short six miles from
Langton. It was all odd and unexpected to Sir Jasper, this
ride at a foot pace through the lonely, hill-girt lands that were
his homeland. He was with the yellow-haired laddie who had
painted dreams for him on the broad canvas of endeavour.
And the dreams had had their end at Derby; and they were
here, beaten men who looked each other in the face and
were content to be together.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are oddly staunch, sir,&#8221; said the Prince by and by.
&#8220;It is good to meet a man in all this wilderness of sleet and
cold arithmetic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was bred to be staunch, your Highness. My father
taught me the way of it&mdash;and his father in the days before.
There&#8217;s no credit to the tree because its roots happen to be
planted deep.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other smiled at Sir Jasper&#8217;s childlike statement of his
case, as if it were a truth plain to all men. &#8220;You&#8217;ve sons
to follow you, I trust? They&#8217;ll be the better for training of
that sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wind blew in bitter earnest now against Sir Jasper&#8217;s
face. All his love for Rupert, all his hidden shame that the
heir could not ride out with him, were so many weights added
suddenly to the burden he was carrying already. &#8220;I have
one son with me in the Rising,&#8221; he said gravely. &#8220;I presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
him to your Highness&mdash;at Langton, I think, when
we rode south.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes.&#8221; The Prince seldom forgot a man&#8217;s record or
his face. &#8220;A ruddy, clean-built youngster, who went pale at
sight of me, as if&mdash;as if, comrade, I were made of less common
clay than he. I remember him. He tried to stammer
out some hero-worship, and I reminded him that his record
was probably cleaner than my own, because the years had
given him less chance of sinning. And he was shocked by
my levity, I think. Yes, it was at Langton, just before the
Vicar went up the street to ring his bells for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once again Sir Jasper was surprised by this Prince&#8217;s close
touch with the road of life as men follow it every day, his
catholic, broad understanding of his fellows. It was the
Stuart gift&mdash;the gift that had carried them to the throne or
to the scaffold&mdash;that they had a kingly outlook on men&#8217;s needs
and their infirmities, and would not surrender, for any wind
of circumstance that blew about them, their royal love for
big or little of the men who trusted them. Sir Jasper was
learning, indeed, what afterwards the folk in Skye were to
learn&mdash;in Skye and in Glenmoriston and in a hundred lonely
glens among the Highlands&mdash;that the Prince he served was
the simplest and most human man, perhaps, among them all.</p>

<p>The wind dropped as they rode, and the sleet ceased falling
for a while; and the sun, an hour before its setting, struck
through the clouds that had hindered it all day. Lights, magical
and vivid, began to paint the land&#8217;s harsh face. The
moorland peaks, to right and left, were crowned with fugitive,
fast-racing mists of blue and green and rose colour; and
ahead of them, astride the steep, curving rise of the highway,
there was a belt of scarlet that seemed to flame the hills with
smoky fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your land is beautiful, Sir Jasper,&#8221; said the Prince, halting
a moment to breathe his horse as they reached the hilltop.
&#8220;I did not guess it when we rode south through sunless
mire.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>It is in time of defeat and stress that the deep chords of a
man&#8217;s soul are struck, and now Sir Jasper&#8217;s face lit up. &#8220;My
land of Lancashire&mdash;it is always beautiful to me. It cradled
me. There&#8217;s no midwinter bleakness can drive away remembrance
of the pleasant days we&#8217;ve shared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak as men do who are married happily,&#8221; laughed
the Prince. &#8220;This barbarous country is just a wife to you,
I think&mdash;her temper may be vile, but you remember gentler
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper fell in with his mood, and smiled as if he jested;
but he talked of matters very dear to the honest, simple heart
of him. &#8220;I can count on my fingers, your Highness, the
things in life that are of importance to me&mdash;my Faith, my
Prince, the wife who&#8217;s waiting for me over yonder at Windyhough,
and my lads&mdash;and the dear moors o&#8217; Lancashire that
bred me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their eyes met; and, somewhere from his tired, hunted
mood, the Prince found a candour equal to Sir Jasper&#8217;s own.
&#8220;Faith first,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;but your wife before your
Prince, by your leave. I&mdash;I have not deserved well of you,
Sir Jasper. I asked you to take me to the throne, and&mdash;I
have given you this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper thought of his wife, her weak caprices, the
yapping of the toy spaniel that had its mimic cradle in their
bedroom at Windyhough&mdash;thought of Rupert, who should
have been beside him now&mdash;thought of all that had hindered
him through these years. For he was not as young as his
keen ardour wished, and these empty days of bodily hardship,
with no reward of fight to hearten them, had sapped his
courage. Yet he responded, bravely enough, to the challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife, God bless her! is&mdash;so dear that we&#8217;ll not give
her any place, your Highness. She claims her own, by
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince puffed gently at the disreputable, blackened
pipe he cherished. He glanced at the hills, saw the next
storm creep grey and wan across the sunset lights. &#8220;It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
a savage land,&#8221; he said dispassionately. &#8220;I never guessed
it could breed courtiers. Your wife, if she were near, would
be pleased to know the temper of your constancy&mdash;it is hard
and lithe as whipcord, sir, like a sword-blade forged by old
Andrew Ferrara.&#8221;</p>

<p>They jogged on again, at the foot pace to which the Prince
had trained himself since Derby; and presently they came
to a broad, grassy lane that led, wide to the left hand, into
the sunset moors. And Sir Jasper checked his horse and sat
rigidly in saddle, looking up the byway.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails you?&#8221; asked the Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remembrance,&#8221; said Sir Jasper, turning his horse&#8217;s head
away from the road it knew by heart. &#8220;It is no time for
rosemary, you think? And yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk in riddles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, pardon me; I talk&mdash;of the road that leads to my own
house of Windyhough&mdash;and to my wife&mdash;and to the son I
left at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, ride across and snatch a glimpse of them,&#8221;
said the other, quick to respond to the need of a man&#8217;s
heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;And desert a retreating army, your Highness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no desertion. We are near our quarters for the
night&mdash;and nothing happens, as you know, in the way of sudden
battles. Our luck is out just now. Go, see your wife,
sir&mdash;you&#8217;ve earned the holiday&mdash;and then ride across country
to Langton. We march from there at daybreak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not ask ease,&#8221; said Sir Jasper stubbornly. &#8220;We&#8217;re
following the road of discipline, and wives, I think, must
wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince glanced pleasantly at him. &#8220;Probe light or
deep, sir, you&#8217;re most amazingly a soldier.&#8221; He smiled&mdash;so
had Mary Stuart smiled once amid disaster, and so had
Charles when he stepped to the scaffold&mdash;secure and gravely
happy. &#8220;You will take your orders,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;as good
soldiers do. There was a breach of discipline&mdash;I forgot to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
chide you when you spoke of it just now. I mean the duel
you provoked with Lord Murray in the wood. Your punishment
is&mdash;just to ride through the vile weather you breed
up here and give my thanks to Lady Royd for the husband
she lent so recklessly to barren leadership. And rejoin me
with the dawn. I command you, sir!&#8221; he added sharply,
seeing that Sir Jasper hesitated still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I obey, your Highness; but you will let me watch
you out of sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why? Langton is so near. Are you afraid that another
band of cavalry&mdash;cart-horse cavalry&mdash;will catch me
up? Miss Demaine&#8217;s mare, that carries me, will show them
light heels enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper looked at this man, whose body and whose soul
were kingly, this man to whom he had entrusted many dreams
and sacrifices. And the tears were in his eyes again, he knew
not why. &#8220;When a man loves deep, your Highness, he fears.
I ask you to let me guard the road behind you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You love me? After this retreat&mdash;after the cursed roads
and hopelessness&mdash;you&mdash;you love me? Say it again, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else? None ever loved a Stuart yet by halves.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince tapped him gently on the shoulder. &#8220;When
better days come in,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall make you acquainted
with my Highlanders. They love as deep as you, and, knowing
myself, I wonder at their blindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was so they parted, wayfarers who had found leal comradeship
and trust. And no momentary parting of the ways
could ever sunder them again; for trust is not born among the
crowded shows of life, but in the lonely byways where man
meets man and finds him likeable.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper sat in saddle at the parting of the ways, and
watched the Prince go slowly up the road. The long strain
was telling on him, and the bitter wind chilled all his outlook
for a moment. A sense of foreboding took him unawares.
It seemed that the Prince, in riding so far behind his army,
was courting death; as if he preferred to be overtaken, here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
in England, rather than go back, a broken man, to his own
land across the border.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he growled, with sharp contempt of the thought.
&#8220;He&#8217;s heart-sick&mdash;but no coward.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave a last glance up the road, as one follows a departing
friend long after he is lost to sight, sighed impatiently,
and turned his horse into the bridle-way that led to
Windyhough. Then he reined about, suddenly aware of galloping
hoofs, of the fret of horses checked too sharply on
the curb, of a harsh voice that bade him halt.</p>

<p>Goldstein&#8217;s men had tracked their quarry, day after patient
day, since their first attempt at Derby to capture the Prince&#8217;s
person. Three times they had found him so far behind his
army that he seemed an easy prey; and three times&mdash;following
what some would call a random whim, and others the
guidance of the God he served&mdash;the Prince, not knowing his
enemies were near, had grown tired of guarding the rear and
had galloped forward suddenly to join his men and pass a
jest among them. And Goldstein knew that his hold on the
rough cavalry he led was weakening day by day. He had
kept them to heel only by crude and persistent reminders that
thirty thousand pounds, as represented by the Stuart, were
worth some patience in the gaining.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, reining sharply round, saw a company of men&mdash;a
score or so&mdash;who wore the Hanoverian livery; and at the
head of them was a blunt, red-featured officer who looked
singularly like a farmer who had lived neighbour to the ale-barrel.
And he knew them for the men who had given chase
at Derby, though as yet they had no answering recollection
of the friend who had ridden close beside the Prince&#8217;s bridle-hand
that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your business, sir?&#8221; asked Goldstein sharply. &#8220;You&#8217;re
too near the retreat to be let pass without a challenge. Besides&#8221;&mdash;with
a laugh, following long scrutiny&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;ve the
look, somehow, of one of those cursed Jacobites.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You flatter me, sir,&#8221; said Sir Jasper coolly. &#8220;It has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
my business in life to feel like one&mdash;and, by your leave, it is
pleasant that you know my breed at sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sleet was drifting in quiet flakes before a wind that
was tired for a while of its own speed. From the western
spur of moor a long, slanting gleam of sunlight lit up this
bleak land&#8217;s loneliness&mdash;lit up Sir Jasper&#8217;s figure as he sat,
unconcerned, disdainful, in the saddle of a restive horse.
For a moment the dragoons drew back; they had lived in a
world where each fought for his own advancement only, and
they were perplexed by this spectacle of a man who, alone and
far behind retreating comrades, made open confession of his
faith.</p>

<p>Goldstein swore roundly&mdash;not as the gently-born do in
times of stress, but like a ploughboy when his team refuses
to obey him. &#8220;Are you a fool, sir?&#8221; he sputtered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes,&#8221; Sir Jasper answered gravely. &#8220;As much as
my fellows. I&#8217;m human, sir, as you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>The troopers laughed, and Goldstein felt his hold on them
grow ever a little and a little less. &#8220;You&#8217;re one of the Pretender&#8217;s
men?&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;We shoot all vermin of that
sort at sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. I am attached to the army of Prince Charles
Edward. No man is a pretender when he asks only for his
own again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re tired of life?&#8221; said Goldstein, trying clumsily
to catch something of Sir Jasper&#8217;s easy handling of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again you are in the wrong. I never guessed, till now,
how good life is. I have been riding with one stronger and
better than myself&mdash;and after that I ride, when you are tired
of questioning me, to the wife and the home I love. It is
all so simple, if you would believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, under all his honesty of speech, was aware that
he was delaying the advance of these rough-riders along the
Langton road, was helping the Prince to safety while he rode
so perilously behind his army. He was aware, too, in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
random way, as he listened to Goldstein&#8217;s queer, guttural
English, that he had been exact when he told Lady Royd, over
and over again, that it was no civil war the Rising men had
stirred up, but simply the resistance of the English to the
foreign invader; a resistance old and stalwart as that of
Hereward the Wake; a resistance that would last the English
till they triumphed or they died.</p>

<p>Goldstein, his muddied wits stirred, may be, by some vision
borrowed from Sir Jasper, knew his man at last. &#8220;It was
you who rode with the Pretender, when we went near to capture
you after Derby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was with the Prince,&#8221; said Sir Jasper, with a smile that
bewildered Goldstein and his troopers; &#8220;but, sir, you did not
come near to capturing us. You were too&mdash;too clumsy, shall
I say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Goldstein&#8217;s troopers liked the free, courageous bearing of
the man, and he knew it. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re here,&#8221; he said dourly.
&#8220;You admit little, but your life&mdash;it&#8217;s not worth a poor man&#8217;s
purchase, surely?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper took a look at the hills, as moor-bred men will
do at these times. &#8220;It was worth a poor Man&#8217;s purchase
once&mdash;near two thousand years ago,&#8221; he said, with the bearing
of a man and the simplicity of a child who does not fear
or doubt.</p>

<p>Goldstein had gone through many a rugged fight, overseas
in Flanders; but the way of this man&#8217;s courage was unfamiliar,
and it daunted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are one-and-twenty of us,&#8221; he said irresolutely,
&#8220;and you&#8217;re alone. You&#8217;ll not fight single-handed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Sir Jasper, handling his snuff-box lazily and
giving no outward sign that he had crossed himself. &#8220;No,
in any case I shall not fight single-handed. Have you any
further questions to ask, sir? The sun is getting down, and
I&#8217;ve a ride before me.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Goldstein this man&#8217;s calm was insolence, and he knew
that he was losing ground constantly with the men behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
him. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve a question or two to ask,&#8221; he snapped.
&#8220;You can buy your life by a straight answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the price may be too heavy,&#8221; protested Sir Jasper.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were with the Pretender soon after Derby, on your
own confession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With Prince Charles Edward, by your leave,&#8221; the other
corrected, with the same pleasant smoothness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, curse you! what do titles matter? The pretty boy
with the love-locks&mdash;you were with him, that day we nearly
took you both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was with him, and it was a privilege. Believe me, sir,
I have some miles to go, and dusk is coming on. Can I
answer any other doubts you have&mdash;of my honesty, shall I
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper had glanced round, had seen a sheer wall of rock,
twenty paces behind him, from which some farmer long ago
had quarried the stones for his homestead on the moor above.
He had chosen his vantage-ground; and still, through all this
talk that gained a few moments by the way, he had only the
one, simple-minded plan&mdash;to get his back to the wall, and fight
single-handed till he dropped, and give his life to earn for
his Prince a few more precious moments. He edged his
horse backward gently&mdash;pretending that it was fidgeting on
the curb&mdash;and drew near the quarry-face. He thought of
Windyhough, of his wife and Rupert, of the free, hard-riding
days behind; and then he thought no more of these things,
but only of the narrow track of loyalty. It was so that the
Lancashire gentry&mdash;the strong men among them&mdash;had trained
themselves to live for the Stuart cause. And, as a man lives,
so he finds himself prepared to die.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the Prince&#8217;s watch-dog,&#8221; said Goldstein.</p>

<p>&#8220;May be. I wish he had a better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s somewhere near then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is vastly probable, sir.&#8221; Sir Jasper glanced at the
hills again, as if seeking counsel. These men had followed
the retreat persistently. If he denied all knowledge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Prince&#8217;s whereabouts, they would spur forward up the main
road, would come in sight of that desolate, square-shouldered
figure who stood, in his own person, for the strength, the
gallantry, the hoping against odds, of this disastrous &#8217;Forty-Five.</p>

<p>He sat in saddle, looking from the hills to the faces of
these one-and-twenty troopers. He needed a ready tongue,
and was more accustomed to straightforward action than to
play of stratagem. He must keep these rascals dallying for
as long as might be, must afterwards lengthen the fight to the
last edge of his strength. He had a single purpose, and his
hold on it was firm&mdash;to keep pursuit at bay until the Prince
rode nearer to Langton and the night&#8217;s bivouac than he did
just now.</p>

<p>And as he tried to find words to relieve the burdensome,
tense silence, Captain Goldstein blundered into one of those
seeming inspirations that lead callous folk into the marshes,
as moorland will-o&#8217;-wispies do. &#8220;The Pretender is afraid
of the thirty thousand pounds on his head,&#8221; he said, turning
to the men behind him. &#8220;The watch-dog is waiting here at
the turning that leads to his own home; the Pretender is out
of sight; the plot is all so childish. Our road lies this way,
and you, sir, will show it to us. The Pretender, I take it, is
your guest to-night&mdash;if we don&#8217;t catch him first? You will
lead us, sir, I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, his back to the quarry-wall now, could not
grasp at once the help this captain of rough-riders was giving
him. His mind was set on the simple business of gaining
time by a fight to the death, and his hand was on his sword-hilt.
&#8220;I never led a rabble yet,&#8221; he said, with easy condescension,
&#8220;and I am too old to learn new exercises.&#8221;</p>

<p>Goldstein was in the company of a gentleman; and, knowing
it, he winced. But he kept his temper; for his view of
life was bounded by advancement, and he wished to make all
sure in this big affair of capturing the Prince, dead or alive.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not deny that the Pretender is making for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
own house?&#8221; he asked, with a sharp glance. &#8220;You&#8217;re
shepherding him along this bridle-track?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would God that his Highness might lie safe at my own
house of Windyhough to-night.&#8221; Even now Sir Jasper
found it hard to lie outright, though he realised suddenly
that there was a better way of service than death at the
quarry-face.</p>

<p>As it chanced, however, his words suggested evasion to
Goldstein&mdash;evasion, and a manifest desire to cloak his errand.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll not show us the way, then? You&#8217;re bent on being
riddled through with bullets? Your sword&#8217;s out&mdash;but it can
whistle as it will. You shall answer it with musketry.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was like Sir Jasper that he had forgotten their firearms
when he drew his sword. Long companionship with those
of his own breed had led him to expect, instinctively, that a
score men, coming up against one, would at least meet him
with his own weapon. He laughed at his own simplicity&mdash;laughed
the more quietly because now it was of no consequence
either way. His view of the Prince&#8217;s safety grew
broader every moment. It was not enough that he should
head off pursuit from him until he had reached safety in to-night&#8217;s
camp at Langton. This company of horse had followed
the retreat so diligently that to-morrow there would be
danger to Stuart&#8217;s person, and the next day after, and every
day that found him riding at the rear of his sad Highlanders.
The plain way of service, as Sir Jasper saw it now, was to
take these nondescript cavalry across country, wide between
the Lancashire hills, and so give the Prince a longer respite
from pursuit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I privileged to change my mind?&#8221; he asked, putting
his sword in sheath again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Allowed to save your skin?&#8221; said Goldstein, the bully in
him quick to take advantage of any show of weakness in an
adversary. &#8220;As for your mind&mdash;you may change it once,
my friend, but not twice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I pledge my honour that I will lead you to Windyhough.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, your honour! That will be safe enough. You
will lead, and my men carry their muskets loaded; and
if anything goes wrong between this and Windyhough&mdash;you&#8217;ll
die for the Stuart, sir,&#8221; he finished, with a savage
grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I make one condition only,&#8221; went on the other suavely&mdash;&#8220;that
I ride at my own pace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is Windyhough from here?&#8221; asked Goldstein,
with suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then ride at any pace you like. If we crawl, we shall be
there before the Pretender has well got through with supper,
and our horses are none too fresh, I own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper took a pinch of snuff, and rode out in silence
from the quarry-face. He was easily master in this enterprise,
and wondered that the gross body of the man could dull
Goldstein&#8217;s reason so completely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will want to share the thirty thousand pounds with
us?&#8221; said Goldstein, feeling now that his men were with him,
answering to his brutal jests. &#8220;You&#8217;ve saved your skin, sir,
and your house of Windyhough; and you need a little ready
money in your pocket. Well, we shall see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper was suddenly ashamed of what these men were
thinking of him. Sensitive, alert, he gauged the meaning of
Goldstein&#8217;s insolence, of the troopers&#8217; careless laughter. They
fancied this was the stuff the Prince&#8217;s gentlemen were made
of&mdash;to talk loftily one moment, and the next to play the traitor
and the coward. They believed, these shock-headed rascals
gathered from the foreign kennels, that a gentleman of
Lancashire could rate his own life dearer than the Stuart&#8217;s,
could afterwards accept blood-money. And then, because he
knew himself, Sir Jasper shrugged his shoulders, as if to rid
them of an evil burden.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ride forward,&#8221; he said, moving from the quarry-face
and trotting to the head of the company.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; said Goldstein, with rough banter; &#8220;and remember,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
sir, that your honour&mdash;your Stuart honour&mdash;is
guarded by one-and-twenty muskets, ready primed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the troopers laughed; and again Sir Jasper&#8217;s instinct
was to vindicate himself. Then he remembered the dogged
patience of another who rode&mdash;in safety, so far&mdash;at the rear-guard
of his army. And he disdained the ill-favoured mob
behind him.</p>

<p>They went up and down the bridle-track that threaded this
white land of hills and cold austerity. It was a track whose
every turning was a landmark to Sir Jasper, reminding him
of other days. He had ridden it when he went hunting&mdash;when
he went south to the wooing; when, afterwards, he
needed respite from the lap-dog follies of his wife, from the
knowledge that his heir was never likely, in this world, at
least, to prove himself a man of action. This lane was thick
with memories for him; but never, until now, had he ridden
it a fugitive.</p>

<p>He thought of Derby and the sick retreat. He thought of
many might-have-beens, and because the pain of it was so
sharp and urgent he gathered up his courage. He held the
Faith; he was strong and stubborn; and out of this windy ride
to his own home he plucked new resolution.</p>

<p>They came&mdash;he and Goldstein&#8217;s men&mdash;to Lone Man&#8217;s Cross,
a wayside monument that marked the spot where a travelling
pedlar had been murdered long ago. And as he passed it
Sir Jasper recalled how, as a boy, he had been afraid to ride
by the spot at dusk. They came to the little kirk of St.
Michael&#8217;s on the Hill, and passed it wide on the left hand,
and went down by way of Fairy-Kist Hollow, where the leafless
rowans were gowned in frosted sleet. From time to time
some ribald jest would come to him from one or other of the
troopers; but he did not heed. One half of him was thinking
of the memories this bridle-track held for him, of the
hopes and fears and gallant dreams that had kept him company
along it in the years gone by; the other half&mdash;the
shrewd-witted, practical half&mdash;was content to know that each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
mile they traversed was leading danger farther from the
Prince, that each step of the rough, up-and-down track was
telling on horses that were too southern in the build for this
cross-country work. His own mare was lithe and easy under
him, for she was hill-bred.</p>

<p>They rode forward slowly through a land that turned constantly
a cold and sleety shoulder to them at every bend of
the way. And they came to the Brig o&#8217; Tryst&mdash;a small and
graceful bridge&mdash;to which, so country superstition said, the
souls truly mated came at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;You live in a cursed climate, Sir Jasper,&#8221; said Goldstein
gruffly; &#8220;and gad! Your roads match it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper was alert again. Some quality in Goldstein&#8217;s
voice roused in him a loathing healthy and inspiriting.
Dreams went by him. He took hold of this day&#8217;s realities,
saw the strip of level going ahead, remembered that he was a
short five miles now from Windyhough, with a game mare under
him. There would be time to get into his own house, to
barricade the doors; and afterwards there would be the swift,
hard battle he had hungered for at Derby.</p>

<p>He put spurs to his mare, and she answered blithely. And
Goldstein understood on the sudden what this gentleman of
Lancashire had meant when he passed his word to lead them,
at his own pace, to Windyhough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt! Fire!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Are you daft, you fools?&#8221;</p>

<p>His men recovered from a surprise equal to his own. The
light was wan and sleety, with mist coming down from the
hills; but the fugitive was well in sight still as they brought
their muskets to the shoulders. A sharp volley rang out between
the silent hills, as if every trooper had pulled his trigger
in instant answer to command. It seemed that one here
and there of the shots would tell; but Sir Jasper went galloping
over the level, and dipped down the further rise, and their
horses would not answer when they tried to gallop in
pursuit.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that is all the wars in Flanders taught you?&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Goldstein savagely. &#8220;You should have brought your wives
to shoot for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A low growl went up. These men were tired of Goldstein&#8217;s
leadership, tired of the hardship and bad weather.
And their leader knew the meaning of that growl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your cursed tempers,&#8221; he said, with what to him
was suavity. &#8220;There&#8217;s the Pretender at the end of this day&#8217;s
journey&mdash;and a price on his head.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Windyhough, Rupert and his mother sat in the parlour,
with its faded scents and tapestries. They waited for great
happenings that did not come their way; and they were sick
at heart. Rupert was hungry for news of the father who was
braver and stronger than he&mdash;the father whom he missed at
every turn of the day&#8217;s road. He had done his round of the
house with Simon Foster; and Nance, who cheered his outlook
for him whenever she came in sight, was absent on some
wild hill-scamper, shared by the broken-winded horse who had
grown close comrade to her.</p>

<p>Lady Royd, with the new-found motherhood that made her
comelier, guessed what was passing in the boy&#8217;s mind; and
she fussed about him, when he was asking only for free air
and the chance to fight like other men. And Rupert thought,
with a shame that deadened all his outlook, of the years when
he had stood, scholarly, ironical, apart from the blood and
tears that meet wayfarers who take the open road. He saw it
all, to-night when the peevish wind was beating through the
draughty house&mdash;saw the weakness that had divided him
from the open-air, good fellows who liked and pitied him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s powder and shot stored here, and I know how to
use them,&#8221; he said, with light contempt of himself. &#8220;And
yet nothing happens, mother. It is as Simon Foster says&mdash;&#8216;we&#8217;re
needing storms and earthquakes, just to make to-day
a little different, like, fro&#8217; yesterday.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, your chance will come,&#8221; said Lady Royd, with the
pitiful feigning of belief that she thought was faith. &#8220;Your
father taught you, just before he went, how to direct a siege.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
You remember that he taught you?&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;He
trusted you to hold Windyhough for the Prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert laughed&mdash;a sudden, dreary laugh that startled her.
&#8220;He taught me well. I&#8217;ve not forgotten the lesson, mother.
But he knew there would be no siege. I heard him tell
you so.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no sharp riding-in of enemies. The night was
still, and empty, and at peace. Yet Lady Royd was plunged
deep, by her own son, into tragedy and battle. She remembered
the night of Sir Jasper&#8217;s departure&mdash;the talk they had
had in hall&mdash;her husband&#8217;s weary confession that he had lied
to Rupert, telling him a fairy-tale of the coming attack on
Windyhough.</p>

<p>Rupert had overheard them, it seemed; and through all
these days of strain and waiting he had not spoken of his
trouble, had let it eat inward like a fire. As if in punishment
for the indifference of earlier years, Lady Royd&#8217;s perception
of all that touched her son was clear to the least detail
now. With her new gift of motherhood, of courting pain
for its own sake, she retraced, step by step, the meaning of
these last few days to Rupert. He had grown used to the
sense that he stood apart from stronger men, unable to share
full life with them; but always, behind it all, he had been
sure, until a little while ago, that his father trusted him to
prove his manhood one day.</p>

<p>She went to him, and put her arms about him, as any cottage
mother might have done. &#8220;Oh, my boy&mdash;my boy!&#8221; she
cried, understanding the fierceness, the loneliness, of this last
trouble.</p>

<p>In this mood of his, with his back to the wall which no
man asked him to defend, Rupert could have withstood many
dangers; but sympathy exasperated him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hard for my father,&#8221; he said, with desperate simplicity.
&#8220;There was never a weak link in the Royd chain
till I was born the heir. Why did I come to&mdash;to bring him
shame?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>Some ruggedness, borrowed from the land that was hers
by marriage, bade Lady Royd stand straight and take her
punishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you why,&#8221; she said, her voice passionate and
low; &#8220;I hindered you before your birth. I went riding when
your father bade me rest at home&mdash;and my horse fell&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as mine did when I went to join the Rising,&#8221; said
Rupert, following his own train of thought. &#8220;Mother, I
should have been with the Prince&#8217;s army now if&mdash;if my horse
had not stumbled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd crossed to the mantel, leaned her head awhile
on the cool oak of it. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, turning sharply.
&#8220;Yes, Rupert. It has taken five-and-twenty years&mdash;but I&#8217;m
answering for that ride of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her in wonder. And suddenly he realised
that this beautiful, tired mother of his was needing help. She
had not guessed what strength there was in her son&#8217;s arms
until he drew her close to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails us, mother?&#8221; he asked, with surprising tenderness.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve Windyhough, and powder and ball, and Lancashire
may need us yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hope took her unawares. This boy was transformed into
a man of action; for only active men can glance from their
own troubles to understand the weakness that is planted, like
lavender, in the heart of every woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would God it needed us,&#8221; she said, with a touch of her
old petulance. &#8220;Lancashire men can sing leal songs
enough&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can live them, too. The hills have cradled us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd smiled, as if her heart were playing round her
lips. &#8220;You&#8217;re no fool, son of mine,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wish the
Retreat were sweeping straight to Windyhough, instead of
leaving us in peace. I wish you could be proved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert glanced shyly at her. He was son and lover both,
diffident, eager, chivalrous. &#8220;Suppose there&#8217;s no attack on
the house, mother&mdash;suppose I were never proved? I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
learned so much to-night&mdash;so much. Surely there&#8217;s something
gained.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a moment of simple, intimate knowledge, each of the
other. And the mother&#8217;s face was flower-like, dainty; the
spoilt wife&#8217;s wrinkles were altogether gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my turn to ask why,&#8221; she said, with a coquetry that
was rainy as an April breeze. &#8220;I&#8217;ve not deserved well of
you, my dear&mdash;not deserved well at all, and have told you
so; and you choose just this time&mdash;to honour me. Men are
perplexing, Rupert. One never knows their moods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her toy spaniel began barking from somewhere at the far
end of the house; and the old inconsequence returned from
habit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s poor Fido crying!&#8221; she said eagerly. &#8220;Go
find him, Rupert. The poor little man is so sensitive&mdash;you
know he&#8217;s almost human, and he is crying for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Rupert went out on the old, foolish quest&mdash;willingly
enough this time. He had seen beneath the foolish, pampered
surface of his mother&#8217;s character, and was content to
hold secure this newborn love for her, this knowledge that she
needed him. He was needed&mdash;at long last.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look gay, master,&#8221; said Simon Foster, meeting him
down the corridor. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s each man to his taste; but I
shouldn&#8217;t have said, like, there was much to hearten a man
these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve not sought in the right place,&#8221; laughed the master.</p>

<p>And then Simon grinned, foolishly and pleasantly. For he
remembered how he had helped Martha the dairymaid to milk
the cows not long ago. &#8220;I&#8217;m not complaining,&#8221; he said,
guardedly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>THE RIDING IN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir Jasper</span>, sure of his mare, had ridden hard toward Windyhough.
He had promised, in good faith, that he would lead
Captain Goldstein on the road, but he had not passed his
word that he would ride at the pace of heavy cavalry. He
heard the bullets singing, right and left and overhead, after
Goldstein&#8217;s call to fire; but the lean, hill-bred mare was going
swiftly under him, and it was only five miles home to Windyhough.
There had been a sharp pain in his left shoulder, a
stab as if a red-hot rapier had pierced him, in the midst of the
crackling musket-din behind him; but that was forgotten.</p>

<p>The mare galloped forward gamely. She was untouched,
save for a bullet that had grazed her flank and quickened her
temper to good purpose. Sir Jasper&#8217;s spirits rose, as the remembered
landmarks swept past him on the wind. His
mind, his vision, his grip on forward hope, were singularly
clear and strong. This was his holiday, after the sickness of
retreat.</p>

<p>He had gained a mile by now. His pursuers, riding jaded
horses, were out of sight and hearing behind the hump of
Haggart Rise. He remembered, once again, the Prince&#8217;s figure,
riding solitary on the Langton road; and he was glad
that these one-and-twenty louts were being led wide of their
real quarry. And then he forgot the Stuarts, and recalled
his wife&#8217;s face, the tenderness he had for her, the peril he
was bringing north to Windyhough. Behind him was Captain
Goldstein, of unknown ancestry and doubtful morals, and
with him a crowd of raffish foreigners, who would follow any
cause that promised licence and good pay.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper saw the danger plainly. He was thinking, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of the Prince&#8217;s honour now, but of his wife&#8217;s. He knew that
he must win to Windyhough. And still his spirits rose; for
this was danger, undisguised and facing him across the sleety,
rugged hills he loved. Windyhough had stout walls, and
powder and ball, and loopholes facing to the four points of
the compass; Simon Foster would be there, and Rupert could
pull a trigger; it would be in the power of this little garrison
to hold the house, to pick off, one by one, this company of
Goldstein&#8217;s until the rest took panic and left it to its loneliness.</p>

<p>It was a hazard to his liking, and Sir Jasper&#8217;s face was
keen and ruddy as he clattered down and up the winding
track. He was a short mile now from Windyhough, and he
eased his mare because she showed signs of trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve time and to spare, lass,&#8221; he muttered, patting her
neck. &#8220;No need to kill you for the Cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then&mdash;from the midst of his eagerness and hope&mdash;a
sickness crept over the horseman&#8217;s eyes. His left shoulder
was on fire, it seemed; and, glancing down, he saw dimly
that his riding-coat was splashed with crimson. The mare,
feeling no command go out across the reins, yielded to her
own weariness, and halted suddenly. Sir Jasper tried to urge
her forward; but his hand was weak on the bridle, and the
grassy track, the hills, the flakes of sleet, were phantoms moving
through a nightmare prison.</p>

<p>He had come to the gate of Intake Farm, and the farmer&mdash;Ben
Shackleton by name&mdash;was striding up the road to
gather in some ewes from the higher lands before the snow
began to drift in earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord love you, sir!&#8221; he said nonchalantly, catching Sir
Jasper as he slid helplessly from saddle. &#8220;Lord love you,
sir, you&#8217;re bleeding like a pig!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing, Ben.&#8221; Even now Sir Jasper kept his spacious
contempt of pain, his instinct to hide a wound as if it
were a crime. &#8220;Help me to horse again. My wife needs
me&mdash;needs me, Ben.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>Then he yielded to sheer sickness for a moment; and Ben
Shackleton, who was used to helping lame cattle, grew brisk
and business-like. &#8220;Here, William!&#8221; he called to a shepherd
who was slouching in the mistal-yard. &#8220;Come lend a hand,
thou idle-bones! Here&#8217;s master ta&#8217;en a hurt, and he&#8217;s a
bulkier man than me. We&#8217;ve got to help him indoors to the
lang-settle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, by grace of long training, was able to keep his
weakness off for a space of time that seemed to him interminable.
He saw Windyhough at the mercy of these ragabouts
of Goldstein&#8217;s&mdash;saw his wife standing, proud, disdainful,
pitiful, while they bandied jests from mouth to mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing, Ben, I tell you!&#8221; he muttered testily.
&#8220;Help me to saddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>He staggered forward, tried to mount, fell back again into
Ben&#8217;s arms. And still he would not yield. And then at last
he knew that Windyhough would not see him to-day, if ever
again; and the pity he had for his wife, left defenceless there
by his own doing, was like a knife cutting deep and ceaselessly
into his living flesh.</p>

<p>He was in torment, so that his wound, save that it hampered
him, seemed a trivial matter. To Ben Shackleton and
the shepherd all passed in a few minutes; they did not guess
how long the interval was to Sir Jasper between this going
down to hell and the first ray of hope that crossed the blackness.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper passed a hand across his eyes. If only he could
understand this sudden hope, the meaning of it&mdash;if his wits
were less muddled&mdash;there was a chance yet for Windyhough.
Then he remembered Rupert&mdash;his son, to whom he had told
a fairy-tale of gunpowder and ball, and the defence of the
old house&mdash;and a weight seemed lifted from him. He recalled
how he had said to the boy&#8217;s mother that Rupert was
leal and stubborn at the soul of him, however it might be with
his capacity for every-day affairs. He smiled, so that Ben
and the shepherd, looking on, thought that he was fey; for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
was thinking how weak in body he himself was, how, like
Rupert, he had only his leal soul to depend upon.</p>

<p>Then, for the last time before he surrendered to the weakness
that was gripping him in earnest, he had a moment of
borrowed vigour. &#8220;Ben,&#8221; he said, in the old tone of command,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve your horse ready saddled?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, sir!&#8221; answered the other, bewildered but obedient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ride hard for Windyhough. There&#8217;s a troop of the
enemy close behind. Gallop, Ben, and tell my son&#8221;&mdash;he
steadied himself, with a hand on the shepherd&#8217;s shoulder&mdash;&#8220;tell
him that he must hold the house until I come, that I
<i>trust him</i>, that he knows where the powder is stored. Oh,
you fool, you stand gaping! And there is urgency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m loath to leave you, Sir Jasper&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be less loath, Ben,&#8221; broke in the other, with a fine
rallying to his shattered strength, &#8220;if I bring the blunt side of
my sword about your ears.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Ben Shackleton, troubled and full of doubt, got to
horse, following that instinct of obedience which the master
had learned before he taught it to his men, and rode up the
windy track. Sir Jasper, when he had seen him top the rise
and disappear in the yellow, dreary haze, leaned heavily
against the shepherd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the lang-settle, since needs must,&#8221; he said, with
a last bid for gaiety. &#8220;I can cross the mistal-yard, I think,
with a little help. So, shepherd! It heaves like a ship in
storm; it heaves, I tell you; but my son out yonder&mdash;my son
at Windyhough&mdash;oh, the dear God knows, shepherd, that I
taught him&mdash;taught him how to die, I hope!&#8221;</p>

<p>They crossed the mistal-yard, blundering as they went;
and somehow the shepherd got Sir Jasper into the cheery,
firelit house-place, and on to the lang-settle. Ben Shackleton&#8217;s
wife was baking an apple-pasty when they came in,
and glanced up. If she felt surprise, she showed none, but
wiped the flour from her arms with her apron, and crossed
to the settle. She looked at Sir Jasper as he lay in a white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and deathlike swoon, and saw the blood oozing from his
wounded shoulder.</p>

<p>Shackleton&#8217;s wife was quick of tongue and quick of her
hands. &#8220;Take thy girt lad&#8217;s foolishness out o&#8217; doors, William!&#8221;
she snapped. &#8220;I know how to dress a wound by
this time, or should do, seeing how oft Shackleton lames himself
by using farm-tools carelessly. Shackleton has a gift
that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd passed out into the windy, cheerless out-o&#8217;-doors.
He knew the mistress in this humour, and preferred
a chill breeze from the east. As he crossed the mistal-yard
he saw a company of horsemen, riding jaded nags; and they
were grouped about Sir Jasper&#8217;s mare, that, too tired to
move, was whinnying for her absent master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, my man!&#8221; said Goldstein. &#8220;Whose mare is this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Jasper Royd&#8217;s,&#8221; the shepherd answered. His voice
was low and pleasant, as the way of Lancashire folk is when
they prepare to meet a bullying intrusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the shepherd, after picking a straw from the
yard and chewing it with bucolic, grave simplicity. &#8220;No.
Sir Jasper changed horses here, and rode for Windyhough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far away?&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd thought of Sir Jasper, lying yonder on the
lang-settle. He was touched, in some queer way, by the master&#8217;s
gallantry in the dark hour of retreat. He was so moved
that he was brought, against his will, to tell a lie and stick
to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, six mile or so, as the crow flies&mdash;more by road,&#8221; he
said nonchalantly. &#8220;Ye&#8217;d best be getting forrard, if ye want
to win there by nightfall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Goldstein mistook this country yokel&#8217;s simplicity for honest
dullness. Men more in touch with the Lancashire character
had done as much before his time, especially when
horse-dealing was in progress on market days. &#8220;You look
honest, my man,&#8221; he said, stooping to slip a coin into William&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
hand. &#8220;Tell me what sort of road it is from here to
Windyhough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as for honest,&#8221; said the other, with the vacant grin
that was expected of him, &#8220;I may be honest as my neighbours,
if that be much to boast of; and it&#8217;s a terrible ill-found
road, for sure. Best be jogging forrard, I tell ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cursed luck, men,&#8221; said Goldstein, spurring his horse
into the semblance of a trot; &#8220;but we&#8217;re hunting big game
this time. A mile or two needn&#8217;t matter. There&#8217;s the Pretender
at Windyhough, remember, and a nice bit of money to
be earned.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd watched them over the hilltop, then glanced
at the piece of silver lying in his palm. There was so much
he might do with this money&mdash;might buy himself a mug or
two of ale at the tavern in the hollow, just by way of changing
the crown-piece into smaller coin&mdash;and he was &#8220;feeling
as if he needed warming up, like, after all this plaguy wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at the coin again, with a wistfulness that was
almost passionate. Then he spat on it, and threw it into the
refuse from the mistal lying close behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I&#8217;ll have honest ale, or none,&#8221; he growled, and
crossed quietly to the house, and stood on the threshold, looking
in.</p>

<p>He saw Shackleton&#8217;s wife bending over Sir Jasper, who
lay in a swoon so helpless and complete that it was like a
child&#8217;s sleep&mdash;a sleep tired with the day&#8217;s endeavours, yet
tranquil and unfearful for the morrow&#8217;s safety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is thee, is&#8217;t?&#8221; said Shackleton&#8217;s wife, facing round.
&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s doing nicely&mdash;or was, till ye let in all this wind
that&#8217;s fit to rouse a body from his grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well-a-day, mistress,&#8221; said the shepherd, with a pleasant
grin, &#8220;if that&#8217;s your humour, I&#8217;m for the mistal-yard again.
It&#8217;s rare and quiet out there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, now,&#8221; she said, glancing up with sharp, imperious
kindliness. &#8220;Shut t&#8217; door, lad, and sit thee down by th&#8217;
peats, and keep a still tongue i&#8217; thy head. I wouldn&#8217;t turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
a dog out into all this storm that&#8217;s brewing up. And, besides,
Sir Jasper&#8217;s mending. I&#8217;d doubts of him at first; but
he&#8217;s sleeping like a babby now. We&#8217;ll keep watch together,
till Shackleton comes home fro&#8217; his ride to Windyhough.
He&#8217;ll not be long, unless the maids there &#8217;tice him to gossip
and strong ale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might smoke, mistress&mdash;just, like, to pass the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, smoke,&#8221; snapped Shackleton&#8217;s wife. &#8220;Men were
always like bairns, needing their teething-rings, in one shape
or another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better than spoiling their tempers,&#8221; said the shepherd.
And he lit his pipe from a live peat, and said no more; for he
was wise, as men go.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>THE GLAD DEFENCE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Windyhough the gale sobbed and moaned about the leafless
trees that sheltered it from the high moors. Sleet was
driving against the window-panes, and there was promise, if
the wind did not change, of heavy snow to follow. And indoors
were Lady Royd and Nance, the women-servants, and
the men too old to carry arms behind Sir Jasper&mdash;these, and
the lean scholar who was heir to Windyhough.</p>

<p>Simon Foster&mdash;he who had carried a pike in the &#8217;15 Rising,
and felt himself the watch-dog here&mdash;had been moving
restlessly up and down all day, like a faithful hound whose
scent is quick for trouble. And now, near three of the afternoon,
he was going the round of the defences once again
with the young master.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not looking just as gay as you were yesternight,&#8221;
he growled, snatching a glance at Rupert&#8217;s face. &#8220;Summat
amiss wi&#8217; the Faith ye hold by, master?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert was sick with bitter trouble, sick with inaction and
the frustration of long hopes; yet he held his head up suddenly
and smiled. &#8220;Nothing amiss with that,&#8221; he answered
cheerily. &#8220;I&#8217;m too weak to carry it at times, that is all,
Simon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simon stroked his cheek thoughtfully. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s all
moonshine to me&mdash;speaking as a plain man; but I&#8217;ve noticed
it has a way o&#8217; carrying folk over five-barred gates and walls
too high to clamber. For my part, I&#8217;m weary, dead weary;
and I see naught before us, master, save a heavy snow-storm
coming, and women blanketing us wi&#8217; whimsies, and a sort o&#8217;
silent, nothing-doing time that maddens a body. You&#8217;ve the
gift o&#8217; faith&mdash;just tell me what it shows you, Maister Rupert.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>The master laughed. It tickled his humour that he, who
was wading deep in sickness and disillusion, should be asked
for help in need by this grizzled elder, who had loved and
pitied him, who had tried, these last days, to teach him the
right handling of a musket. &#8220;Just this, Simon&mdash;square
shoulders, and a quick eye, and the day&#8217;s routine ahead.
What else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then faith is a soldier&#8217;s game, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a soldier&#8217;s game,&#8221; Rupert answered dryly.</p>

<p>And so they went forward from room to room, from loophole
to loophole, that cast slant, grey eyes on the sleet that
was blowing across the troubled moonlight out of doors.
And, at the end of the round, after Simon had gone down to
see if he could catch a glimpse of Martha in the kitchen, Rupert
heard the sound of spinet keys, touched lightly from below.
And then he heard Nance Demaine singing the ballads
that were dear to him, and a sudden hunger came upon him.</p>

<p>He went down to the parlour, stood silent in the doorway.
Lady Royd was upstairs, putting her toy spaniel to bed with
much ceremony; and Nance was alone with the candlelight
and the faded rose-leaf scents. With ache of heart, with a
longing strong and troublesome, he saw the trim figure, the
orderly brown hair, the whole fragrant person of this girl
who was singing loyal ballads&mdash;this girl who kept his feet
steady up the hills of endeavour, and of longing for the battle
that did not come his way.</p>

<p>And the mood took Nance to sing a ballad of the last Stuart
Rising, thirty years ago, when all was lost because the
leaders of the enterprise were weaker than the men who rode
behind them.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;There&#8217;s a lonely tryst to keep, wife,</div>
<div class="indent">All for the King&#8217;s good health.</div>
<div class="verse">God knows, when we two bid farewell</div>
<div class="indent">I give him all my wealth.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>It was the song of a cavalier, written to his wife the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
before he went to execution for the Stuart&#8217;s sake. And it
had lived, this ballad, because to its core it rang true to the
heart&#8217;s love of a man. And Nance was singing it as if she
understood its depth and meaning. This was the man&#8217;s love,
royal, simple, courageous, of which she had talked to Lady
Royd not long ago, for which she had been laughed at by
the older woman. Yet one man at least had found grace to
carry such love with him unblemished to the scaffold. The
resignation, the willing sacrifice for kingship&#8217;s sake summed
up by &#8220;the lonely tryst to keep,&#8221; as if this were a little matter&mdash;the
human note of loss and heartbreak when she reached
the last love confession, strong, tender, final in its simplicity&mdash;Nance&#8217;s
voice found breadth and compass for them all, as
if she had stood by this cavalier long dead, feeling pulse by
pulse with him. And so, in a sense, she had; for these royalists
of Lancashire had faults and weaknesses in plenty, but
they had been strong in this&mdash;from generation to generation
they had reared their children to a gospel resolute and thorough
as the words of this old ballad.</p>

<p>Nance lingered on those last words as if they haunted her&mdash;&#8220;I
give him all my wealth.&#8221; And Rupert, standing in
the doorway, was aware that, even to his eyes, Nance had
never shown herself so tender and complete. She leaned
over the spinet, touching a key idly now and then; and her
thoughts were of Will Underwood, who had courage of a
sort, a fine, reckless horsemanship that was needed by the
Rising; of Wild Will, whose whole, big, dashing make-believe
of character was ruined by a mean calculation, a need to keep
houseroom and good cheer safe about him. She remembered
her trust in him, their meeting on the moor, the sick,
helpless misery that followed. And then she thought of Rupert,
standing scholarly and apart from life&mdash;no figure of a
hero, but one whom she trusted, in some queer way, to die
for the faith that was in him, if need asked. And then again
she laughed, a little, mournful laugh of trouble and bewilderment.
Life seemed so wayward and haphazard, such a waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
of qualities that were hindered by weaknesses tragic in their
littleness. If Rupert&#8217;s steady soul could be housed in Will
Underwood&#8217;s fine, dominant body, the world would see a man
after its own heart.</p>

<p>And Rupert had his own thoughts, too, in this silence they
were sharing. He knew to a heart-beat the way of his love
for Nance, the gladness and the torture of it; and again he
wondered, with passionate dismay, that he had done so little
to make himself a man of both worlds, ready to fight
through the open roads for her. He had given her a regard
that, by its very strength and quality, was an honour in the
giving and the receiving; he had built high dreams about
her, feeling her remote and unattainable; but he had failed
in common sense, in grasp of the truth that a man, before
he reaches the hilltops where high dreams find reality, must
climb the workaday, rough fields. He understood all this,
knew for the first time that his father had been just in leaving
him behind, because the fighting-line needs men who can
use their two hands, can sit a horse, can face, not death only
but all the harsh, unlovely details that war asks of men. His
humiliation was bitter and complete. There was Nance, sitting
at the spinet, the gusty candlelight playing about her
trim, royal little figure, and she was desirable beyond belief;
and yet he knew that she stood, not for faith only but for
deeds, that he had only gone a few paces on the road that
led to the fulfilment of his dreams.</p>

<p>The silence was so intimate, so full of the strife that hinders
comrade souls at times, that Nance knew she was not
alone. She glanced up, saw Rupert standing in the doorway,
read the misery and longing in his face. For women
have a gift denied to men&mdash;they see us as an open book, clear
for them to read, while we can only sight them at odd moments,
like startled deer that cross the mountain mists.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sad, my dear,&#8221; she said, with pleasant handling
of the intimacy that had held between them since they were
boy and girl together.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, hard pressed and dour. &#8220;I am&mdash;your
fool, Nance, as I always was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come sit beside me,&#8221; she commanded. &#8220;I shall sing
Stuart songs to you&mdash;sing them till you hear the pipes go
screeling up Ben Ore, till I see the good light in your face
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her tenderness was hard to combat. &#8220;I need no Stuart
songs,&#8221; he said, with savage bluntness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, you&#8217;re changeable. You liked them once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll like them again, Nance&mdash;but not to-night. It is Stuart
deeds I ask, and they do not come my way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert had crossed to the spinet, and, as he stood looking
down at her with grave eyes, Nance was aware of some new
mastery about him, some rugged strength that would have
nothing of this indoor, parlour warmth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rupert, what is amiss with you?&#8221; she asked gravely.</p>

<p>He was himself again&mdash;scholarly, ironic. &#8220;What is amiss?
You, and the house where I&#8217;m left among the women, because
I have learned no discipline&mdash;it is a pleasant end, Nance, to
my dreams of the riding out. Your fool, listening to his
mother&#8217;s spaniel whining as she puts him to bed, and the
empty house, and the wind that calls men out to the open&mdash;just
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came near to understanding of him now. While there
was peace, and no likelihood at all of war, he had been content,
in his odd, indifferent way, to stand apart from action.
But now that war had come he reached back along the years
ashamed and impotent, for the training other men had undergone&mdash;the
training that made his fellows ready to follow the
unexpected call, the sudden hazard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is cruel!&#8221; said Nance, with a quick, peremptory lifting
of the head. &#8220;You could fight, if only they would let
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so. The bird could fly, if its wings had not been
broken in the nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew this dangerous, still mood of his. He was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
civilian, untrained, unready, left at home while stronger men
were taking the hardships. In every line of his face, in the
resolute, dark eyes, there was desperate shame and self-contempt;
and yet he fancied he was hiding all show of feeling
from her. Nance felt the pity of it&mdash;felt more than pity&mdash;found
the tears so ready that she turned again to the spinet
and began playing random odds and ends of ballads. And
through all the stress she took a grip of some purpose that had
been with her constantly these last days. Will Underwood&mdash;his
dominant, big person, his gift of wooing&mdash;had gone from
her life. She was lonely and afraid, and found no help except
along the road of sacrifice&mdash;the road trodden hard and
firm by generations of women seeking help in need.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me mend your life for you,&#8221; she said, glancing up
with bewildering appeal and tenderness.</p>

<p>Rupert was young to beguilement of this sort. Her eyes
were kindly with him. There was a warmth and fragrance
round about the parlour that hindered perception of the finer
issues. And he knew in this moment that even a good love
and steady can tempt a man unworthily.</p>

<p>From the moors that guarded Windyhough there came a
sudden fury of the wind, a rattle of frozen sleet against the
windows. And Rupert lifted his head, answering the bidding
of the open heath. &#8220;You cannot mend my life,&#8221; he said
sharply. &#8220;How could you, Nance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought so once.&#8221; Her glance was friendly, full of
affection and great liking; and so well had she been schooling
herself to the new, passionate desire for sacrifice that Rupert
read more in it than the old comradeship. &#8220;What have I
done, that I cannot help you now?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was dizzied by the unexpectedness, the swiftness of this
night surprise. Here was Nance, her face turned eagerly
toward him, and she was reminding him of the devotion he
had shown her in years past. He had no key to the riddle,
could not guess how desperate she was in her wish to hide
Will Underwood&#8217;s indignities under cover of this sacrifice for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Rupert&#8217;s sake&mdash;Rupert, whom she liked so well and pitied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I not sing to you now?&#8221; she repeated, with pleasant
coquetry. &#8220;If you have no Stuart songs&mdash;why, let me sing
you Martha&#8217;s doleful ballad of Sir Robert who rode over
Devilsbridge, and came riding back again without his head.
It was a foolish thing to do, but it makes a moving ballad,
Rupert.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mood would not be denied. Tender, gay, elusive, she
tempted him to ask what she was ready&mdash;for sake of sacrifice&mdash;to
give. There was reward here for the empty boyhood,
the empty days of shame since the men of the house
rode out. It was all unbelievable, unsteadying. He had only
to cross to Nance&#8217;s side, it seemed, had only to plead, as he
had done more than once in days past, for the betrothal kiss.
He recalled how she had met these wild love-makings of his&mdash;with
pity and a little laughter, and a heart untouched by
any sort of love for him. And now&mdash;all that was changed.</p>

<p>The moment seemed long in passing. Within reach there
was Nance, desirable beyond any speech of his to tell; and yet
he could not cross to her. It was as if a sword divided them,
with its keen edge set toward him. He did not know himself,
could not understand the grip that held him back from
her, though feet and heart were willing. Then it grew clear
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nance,&#8221; he said sharply, &#8220;do you remember the Brig o&#8217;
Tryst?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; she answered, with simple tenderness. &#8220;I
remember that I hurt you there. You pleaded so well that
day, Rupert&mdash;and now you&#8217;re dumb, somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;Nance, there has war come since then, and it
has proved us all.&#8221; He laughed, the old, unhappy laugh of
irony and self-contempt. &#8220;There&#8217;s Simon Foster, bent with
rheumatism, and Nat the Shepherd, too infirm to do anything
but smoke his pipe and babble of the &#8217;15 Rising, and&mdash;your
fool, Nance. You&#8217;ve a gallant house of men about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Nance was silent. Some deeper feeling than pity or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
haphazard sacrifice was stirring her, for she saw Rupert as
he was, saw him with a clearness, a knowledge of him, that
would never leave her. In retreat, against his will, in utter
darkness of hope and forward purpose, he had found the
right way and the ready to Nance&#8217;s heart. His grip of honour
was so resolute. There was nothing scholarly or fanciful
about him now. Through temptation of her own making,
through a desire extreme and passionate and easy to be
read, he had won through to this starry sort of abnegation
that set well on him. He was no proven man, and he disdained
for that reason to claim a woman&#8217;s favours; and the
breed of him showed clear.</p>

<p>The wind swept down from the moors with a snarl that set
the windows shaking. And Rupert, without a backward
glance, went into the hall and opened the main door. The
wind came yelping in, powdering the threshold with driven
sleet and chilling him to the bone. He was aware only of
heart-sickness, of the fragrance that was Nance Demaine, of
his need to get out into the open road; and there was something
in the lash of the sleet across his face that was friendly
as the moors he loved.</p>

<p>And as he stood there he heard the <i>tippety-tap</i> of hoofs,
far down the bridle-road that led to Windyhough. And
hope, a sudden vivid hope, returned to him. He had not
needed the warm, scented parlour, the songs of old allegiance;
but, to the heart of him, he was eager for this music
of a hard-riding man who brought news, maybe, of Stuart
deeds.</p>

<p><i>Tippety-tap, tappety-tip</i>, the sound of hoofs came intermittently
between the wind-bursts, and it seemed now to be very
near the gate. While he waited, his head bent eagerly
toward the track, Lady Royd came downstairs after bidding
her spaniel good-night, shivered as the wind swept through
the hall, and ran forward fretfully when she saw Rupert
standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, is it not cold enough already in the house?&#8221; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
complained. &#8220;You need not let the wind in through open
doors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, mother!&#8221; he said, not turning his head. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a horseman riding fast. He is bringing news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are fanciful. This Hunter&#8217;s Wind always sent
your wits astray, Rupert. You heard too many nursery-tales
of the Ghostly Hunt, and Gabriel&#8217;s Hounds, and all their foolish
superstitions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear a rider coming up with news,&#8221; said Rupert obstinately,
moving out into the courtyard. &#8220;It may be Oliphant
of Muirhouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simon Foster, at this time, was just outside the gate, working
to the last edge of dusk to get in a few more barrow-loads
of wood for the indoor fires. Not all the scoldings of
the other servants had persuaded him to so necessary a bit
of work, but Martha had, when she drew a tearful picture
of the cold kitchen they would have to sit in to-night if he
failed them. There were barely logs enough, it seemed, to
feed the rest of the house, and the kitchen must go fireless.
And Simon, with steady contempt of household labour when
he longed to be out in the open fight, had grumbled his way
to the pile of tree-trunks that littered the outside of the courtyard.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I thought myself a fighting man,&#8221; he muttered, sawing
and chopping with a speed born, not of zeal, but of ill-temper;
&#8220;and the end of it all is just bringing wood in, so that
silly wenches can sit up late and gossip over a wasteful fire.
Well, life&#8217;s as it&#8217;s made, I reckon, but I&#8217;m varry thankful I
had no hand i&#8217; the making.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had filled his barrow, and was stooping to the handles,
when he, too, heard the beat of hoofs come ringing up between
the wind-beats. The storm, perhaps, had stirred even
his unfanciful outlook upon life; for he was strangely restless
to-night, and ready to believe that some miracle might
come to rouse them from their fireside life at Windyhough.
He turned his head up-wind, one hairy ear cocked like a spaniel&#8217;s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and listened for a while. The gale began to fall a little,
and he could hear the quick, recurrent <i>tippety-tap</i> more
frequently.</p>

<p>He left his barrow, hobbled across the courtyard, saw Rupert
and his mother standing in the light of the scudding
moon that fought for mastery with the gloaming.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a horse galloping, Simon,&#8221; said Rupert. &#8220;Did
you hear him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, I heard him right enough; and I&#8217;m wondering who
the rider is. It might be Sir Jasper, or it might be one o&#8217;
Maister Oliphant&#8217;s wild-riding breed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re mistaken, both of you!&#8221; broke in Lady Royd
fretfully. &#8220;The snow would deaden hoof-beats. I can hear
none, I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said Simon stolidly, &#8220;the road&#8217;s harder than the
snow&#8217;s soft just yet. By and by it will be different, when the
wind drops. We&#8217;ll be snowed up by morn, my lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now her untrained ear caught the <i>tippety-tap</i>, the ring
of a gallop close at hand. &#8220;It may be Sir Jasper,&#8221; she echoed.
&#8220;Oh, I trust you are right, Simon&mdash;so long as he rides unwounded,&#8221;
she added, quick to find the despondent note.</p>

<p>The wind was settling fast. Now and then it yelped and
whined like a dog driven out from home on a stark night;
but the snow was falling ever a little more steadily, more
thickly. And into the blur of snow and moonlight, across
the last edge of the gloam, the galloping horseman rode
through the open gate into the courtyard, and pulled up, and
swung from saddle. He looked from one to another of those
who stood this side the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, Master Rupert?&#8221; he asked, without sign of
haste or emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Shackleton. What&#8217;s your news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Jasper&#8217;s lying at my farm. He&#8217;s ta&#8217;en a hurt, and
sent me forrard&mdash;seeing he couldn&#8217;t come himself&mdash;and he
said to me that you&#8217;re to keep Windyhough against a plaguy
lot o&#8217; thieves.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>&#8220;What thieves, Ben?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I know not. He said they were riding an odd mile
or two behind, and no time to waste.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd was crying softly in the background, secure in
her belief that the worst had happened and that her husband&#8217;s
hurts were mortal. Rupert did not heed her, did not heed
anything except the tingling sense of mastery and strength
that was firing his young, unproved soul. Through the long
nights and days of self-contempt he had longed for this.
When his heart had been sick to find himself among the
women and the greybeards, he had fought, as if his life depended
on it, for the dim hope that his chance would come one
day. And, because he was prepared, there was no surprise
in Shackleton&#8217;s news, no hurried question as to how this sudden
onset must be met.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father sent no other message, Ben?&#8221; he asked curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, he did, and he seemed rare and anxious I shouldn&#8217;t
forget it, like. He said he <i>trusted you</i>&mdash;just trusted you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert had kept his watch, through the sickness of the waiting-time;
and at the end of it was this trumpet-call from the
father who had bred him. And Simon Foster, watching him
with affection&#8217;s close scrutiny, saw the scholarly, lean years
slip off from the shoulders that were squared already to the
coming stress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bar the outer gate, Simon,&#8221; he said. Then, with a
soldier&#8217;s brisk attention to detail, he turned to Ben Shackleton.
&#8220;How many of them?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A score or more, so Sir Jasper said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then step indoors. We need you, Ben.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shackleton made a movement to get up to saddle again.
&#8220;Nay, nay! I&#8217;ve the kine to fodder, and a wife waiting for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in command here,&#8221; said the master sharply. &#8220;We
need you, and you say there&#8217;s no time to waste.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simon Foster came back from drawing the stout oaken
bars across the gate. &#8220;They&#8217;re riding up the gap,&#8221; he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
&#8220;I could hear their horses slipping all ways, master, as if
the roads had teazed &#8217;em; but they&#8217;re riding varry near.
We haven&#8217;t a year and a day to waste in talk, though Shackleton
fancies we have. Besides,&#8221; he added grimly, &#8220;the gate&#8217;s
barred, and they&#8217;ll be here before you could open it and ride
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s to be done with my horse, supposing I did stay?&#8221;
asked Shackleton. Like a true farmer, he was not to be hurried,
and his first thought was always for his live-stock.</p>

<p>Simon Foster snatched the bridle from his hand, went across
to the stables, and was back again before Shackleton had recovered
from his surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is horse-stealing, Simon, or summat like it,&#8221; grumbled
the farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Simon, &#8220;it&#8217;s horse-keeping. We need you,
Ben. The master spoke a true word there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s all the moil about? I relish a square fight
as well as another; it&#8217;s a bit of a holiday, like, fro&#8217; farming
peevish lands; but I like to know just what I&#8217;m fighting for.
Stands to plain reason I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the honour of the Royds,&#8221; said Rupert, with sharp
appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, you have me, master. Just tell me what I&#8217;ve
to do; I&#8217;m slow i&#8217; my wits, but quick wi&#8217; my hands, and
always was; and I learned young to fire a musket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a varry good habit to learn,&#8221; growled Simon Foster,
&#8220;&#8217;specially when a body learns it young.&#8221; And then again
he turned his head sharply. &#8220;They&#8217;ve come, I reckon, master,&#8221;
he said, with stolid satisfaction.</p>

<p>Goldstein&#8217;s men had ridden the last mile of their journey in
evil temper. The track was rough, full of steep hills and
sharp, dangerous corners that rendered it difficult enough in a
dry season; in this weather, and in the snowy, muddled light,
it seemed impassable to horsemen used only to flat country.
They were hungry, moreover, and wet to the skin, and their
only achievement so far was to lose the first fugitive they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
had pursued since Derby town was left behind. Goldstein
himself was thankful for one thing only&mdash;that this lonely track
had no byways opening out on either hand. The road, twist
as it would, kept to its single line, showing them no choice of
route in a country unknown and difficult.</p>

<p>It seemed interminable, this travelling at a slow, uneasy
trot over broken ground; but, just as he began to fear that
his men would mutiny outright, he looked up the rise ahead
and saw lights twinkling through the moonlit storm of snow.
The lights were many, blinking down on him from a house
that surely, by the length of its front, was one of quality.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re home, my lads,&#8221; he said, with a sharp laugh of relief.
&#8220;That yokel lied about the distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Time we were,&#8221; snarled one of the troopers, with a
rough German oath.</p>

<p>Goldstein did not heed, but slipped from saddle and put a
hand to the courtyard gate. When he found it barred, he
thrust his heavy bulk against it. It did not give to his
weight. And this daunted him a little; for he had not looked
for resistance of any sort, once they had reached the end of
this long, hilly road. He had pictured, indeed, a house of
women, with only the Prince and Sir Jasper to stand against
them, a swift surprise, and after that food and licence and
good liquor to reward them for the hardships of the day. He
kicked the gate impatiently, and cried to those within to open;
and the dogs shut up in kennel answered him with long, running
howls.</p>

<p>Rupert standing with Simon Foster on the threshold of the
porch, felt gaiety step close to his elbow, like a trusted friend.
He crossed the yard and stood just this side the gateway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who knocks?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King,&#8221; snapped Goldstein.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be more explicit,&#8221; said Rupert, with a touch
of the old scholarly disdain. &#8220;By your voice, I think you
come from Hanover. We serve the Stuart here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the spite of the falling wind, through his weariness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
of mind and body, Goldstein knew that a gentleman
stood on the far side of this gateway. And breeding, in a
farm-hand or a king, disturbed his sordid outlook on this
life.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not serve him long. Where&#8217;s Sir Jasper Royd?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somewhere on the open road, following his Prince. I
am his son, and master here, at your service, till he returns.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance, hearing the confusion out of doors, had run into
the courtyard. Lady Royd was standing apart, as if nothing
mattered, now she had heard that Sir Jasper lay wounded at
the farm; if her man had not been strong enough to ride in
and guard her at such a time, he must be near to death, she
felt. She had made him her idol, starving her sons of love
because the father claimed it; and she was paying her debts
now, in confusion and humiliation. Nance scarcely heeded
her. Her eyes passed from Simon and Ben Shackleton to
the slim, erect figure at the gate, and instinctively she crossed
to Rupert&#8217;s side. There was peril on the far side of this
gate&mdash;peril grave and urgent&mdash;and yet she was conscious only
of a thrill of pride and tenderness. The scholar had longed
for his chance to come; and the answer had reached him,
without warning or preparation, from the heart of the stormy
night. Her thoughts were running fast; she contrasted Will
Underwood&#8217;s response to the first call of the Rising with Rupert&#8217;s
gay acceptance of this hazard; and she was glad to be
here at Windyhough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Jasper&#8217;s &#8216;on the open road, following his Prince&#8217;?&#8221;
mimicked Goldstein, breaking the uneasy silence. &#8220;To be
plain, he has followed the Pretender indoors here, and I know
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert had known only that he was bidden to guard the
house against what Shackleton had named &#8220;a plaguy lot o&#8217;
thieves,&#8221; had accepted the trust with soldierly obedience; but
the venture showed a new significance. He was cool-headed,
practical, now that his years of high dreaming were put to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the touchstone; and he snatched at Goldstein&#8217;s explanation
of this night assault.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think the Prince is a guest here at Windyhough?&#8221;
he asked suavely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it. We&#8217;ve followed the two of them over the
foulest bridle-track in England&mdash;just because we were so
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper&#8217;s heir looked at the sturdy, snow-blurred gate
that stood between the honour of his house and these troopers,
whose oaths, with an odd lack of discipline, threaded all their
leader&#8217;s talk. And he laughed, so quietly that Nance glanced
sharply up, thinking his father had returned; for Sir Jasper
carried just this laugh in face of danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince is here?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then hack your way
through the gate and take him. He is well guarded.&#8221;</p>

<p>Goldstein, chilled for a moment by the unexpected strength
of the defence, grew savage. &#8220;You&#8217;ll not surrender?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No Royd does, sir. We live leal, or we die leal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then God help you when my troopers hack a way in!
They&#8217;re not tame at any time, and your cursed roads have not
smoothed their tempers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are waiting,&#8221; said the master quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well done, Rupert!&#8221; whispered Nance, with a light
touch on his arm.</p>

<p>He looked down at her&mdash;down and beyond her, for in
truth he had no need of Stuart glamour till this night&#8217;s business
was well through. &#8220;You Nance? Get back to the
house, and take my mother with you; the gate will be down,
I tell you, and after that&mdash;it will be no place for women. And,
Simon,&#8221; he added, &#8220;bring three muskets out. Hurry, man!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance, high-spirited and new to commands of this sharp,
peremptory kind, went submissively enough, she knew not
why. And, near the porch, she found Lady Royd busy with
the spaniel which had run out to find her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little man!&#8221; Sir Jasper&#8217;s wife was murmuring, as
she kissed the foolish, pampered brute that, under happier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
auspices, would have been a dog. &#8220;He missed me, Nance,
and he came, getting wet feet in the snow, and you know how
delicate he is. He is all I have, Nance,&#8221; she added, with a
touch of pathos, real in its futility &#8220;since&mdash;since they told me
Sir Jasper was dying at the farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance remembered how Rupert had met the sudden call to
arms, and gathered something of his buoyancy. &#8220;Sir Jasper
is not dying,&#8221; she said sharply. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not believe it. He
will come by and by, when he has recovered from his
wound&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think he will come?&#8221; put in the other, helpless and
snatching at any straw of comfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know it; but we must get indoors, and let Rupert
guide the siege.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd had not learned the true gaiety of danger; but
Nance, from the childhood shared with hard-riding brothers,
had gained a courage and experience that served her well
just now. None knew what would chance to Windyhough
before the dawn; and, for her part, she did not look before
or after, but took the present as it came. And her instinct
was Rupert&#8217;s, as she shepherded Lady Royd into the hall&mdash;that
here at last, thank God! was action after long sitting by
the hearth.</p>

<p>Captain Goldstein, meanwhile, convinced that his entry into
Windyhough was not to be bloodless, after all, had tried his
strength once more against the gate of the courtyard, and,
finding it solid, had cast about for some way of breaking
through it. The moon was making greater headway now
through the rifted snow-clouds, and he saw the pile of tree-trunks
at which Simon Foster had been busy until Sir Jasper&#8217;s
messenger had disturbed him at the wood-chopping.</p>

<p>Like his troopers, Goldstein was wet and hungry and impatient,
and his one thought was to rive the gate down,
whatever strength opposed him on the far side of it. He
gave a sharp order, and six of his men lifted a trunk of sycamore,
and poised it for a while, and rammed the gate. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
first thrust strained the gate against the cross-bars, and broke
back sharply on the men who held the ram, disordering them
for a moment.</p>

<p>The master waited, his musket ready primed. &#8220;Simon,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and you, Ben Shackleton, we&#8217;re bidden to hold the
house, but gad! we&#8217;ll do a little in the courtyard first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Goldstein&#8217;s men came at the gate again, struck savagely,
found by chance a weak spot in the wood. And this time
they splintered a wide opening. They drew back a little, to
get their breath, and through the opening Rupert saw faintly
in the moonlight the half of a man&#8217;s body. Simon Foster,
watching him, saw a still, passionless light steal into his
eyes as he lifted the musket to his shoulder and fired with
brisk precision. There was a cry of anguish from without,
a sudden, heavy fall, and afterwards the guttural voice of Captain
Goldstein, bidding his troopers clear the dead away and
ram the gate again.</p>

<p>Rupert, for his part, was reloading. And he was tasting
that exquisite, tragic glee known only to those who kill their
first man in righteous battle. He was drinking from a well
old as man&#8217;s history; and its waters, while they swept compunction
and all else away, gave him a strange zest for this
world&#8217;s adventures.</p>

<p>The troopers were desperate now. They rammed the splintered
gate with a fury that broke the cross-bars; and Lady
Royd, watching it all from the porch, saw a troop of savages,
dusky in the moonlight&mdash;let loose from hell, so it seemed
to her disordered fancy&mdash;swarm through the opening. She
glanced at Rupert, saw him take careful aim again; and this
time there was no cry from the fallen, for he dropped dead in
his paces, so suddenly that the man behind tripped over him.</p>

<p>Simon Foster, who had preached the gospel of steadiness
so constantly to the young master, aimed wildly at Goldstein,
and missed him by a foot; but Shackleton, slow and sure by
temperament, picked out a hulking fellow for his mark and
hit him through the thigh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>&#8220;Get to the house!&#8221; said Rupert, his new mastery sitting
firm and lightly on him.</p>

<p>Like the Prince in retreat, he stood aside till his men had
found safety, and then passed in himself. A few shots spattered
on the house-front, and one grazed his shoulder; but the
enemy were huddled too close together in the courtyard, and
they jostled one another while talking hurried aim. Just in
time he leaped across the threshold, clashed the main door in
Goldstein&#8217;s face, and shot the bolts home.</p>

<p>Inside, the first note that greeted him was the yapping of
his mother&#8217;s spaniel. And his eyes sought Nance&#8217;s with instinctive
humour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rupert, how can you smile?&#8221; asked Lady Royd, distraught
and fretful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because needs must, mother,&#8221; he answered gently. &#8220;And
now, by your leave, you will take Nance upstairs. There&#8217;s
work to be done down here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance touched his arm in passing. He did not know it.
Body, and soul, and mind, he was bent on this work of holding
Windyhough for his father and the Prince. He had lived
with loneliness and patience and denial of all enterprise; and
now there was a virile havoc about the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the good siege, Simon,&#8221; he said, listening to the
uproar out of doors.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>THE BRUNT OF IT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> master turned from the doorway to find the women-servants
and old Nat, the shepherd, crowded at the far end
of the hall. They were agape with mingled fear and curiosity,
and they were chattering like magpies.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be murdered outright,&#8221; said the kitchen-maid, her
pertness gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; wept the housekeeper, &#8220;and me that has prayed,
day in and day out for fifty years, that I&#8217;d die easy and
snuglike i&#8217; my bed. There&#8217;s something not modest in dying
out o&#8217; bed, I always did say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The master flashed round on them; and, without a word
said, they obeyed the new air of him, and crept shamefacedly
along the corridor. Only Nat stood his ground&mdash;Nat, who
was old beyond belief, whose hand shook on the long clay
pipe that ceased burning only when he slept.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a terrible moil and clatter, master,&#8221; he said, laughing
vacantly. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be an odd few wanting to get indoors,
I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Nat, yes,&#8221; said the master impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ye munnot let &#8217;em. And there&#8217;ll be a fight like;
but, bless ye, &#8217;twill be naught to what we saw i&#8217; the &#8217;15 Rising.
I was out i&#8217; it wi&#8217; your father, and men were men i&#8217;
those days. Eh, but there were bonnie doings!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat had forgotten that the &#8217;15 had been more hapless and
ill-conducted than this present Rising. He was back again
with the young hope, the young ardour, that had taken him
afield; and he was living in the dotard&#8217;s sanctuary, where all
old deeds seem well done and only the present lacks true
warmth and colour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>&#8220;He tells his lie varry well, and sticks to it,&#8221; laughed
Simon Foster. &#8220;I was out i&#8217; that Rising myself, master, as
you know, and if there were any bonnie doings, I never
chanced on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nat is not wise. Let him be,&#8221; said the master, with a
chivalrous regard that was cradled deep in the superstitions
of the moor.</p>

<p>The men without were battering uselessly at the great,
nail-studded door. It had been built in times when callers
were apt to come knocking on no peaceful errand; and it
was secure against the battering-ram that had splintered the
weaker courtyard gate. For all that, Rupert bade Simon
and Ben Shackleton help him to up-end the heavy settle that
stood along the wall. They buttressed the door with it, and
were safe on this side of the house from any rough-and-ready
method of attack.</p>

<p>Then Rupert, precise in his regard for detail, led them to
the kitchens. The women were huddled over a roaring fire
of logs&mdash;the fruits of Simon&#8217;s industry not long ago&mdash;but
Rupert did not heed them. The mullioned windows of the
house were stout and narrow, and the only inlet, now the
main door was safe, was by this kitchen entrance. The door
was not wide enough to admit more than one man at a time,
and its timbers could be trusted to resist attack until warning
had been given to the garrison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martha,&#8221; said the master, choosing by instinct the one
reliable wench among these chatterboxes, &#8220;your post is at the
door here. You will warn us if there is trouble on this side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, aye,&#8221; she answered cheerfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ve clouted a
man&#8217;s lugs before to-day, and can do it again, I reckon.&#8221;
And she picked up her milking-stool, which was lying under
the sink in readiness for the morrow&#8217;s milking, set it down
by the door, and seated herself with a deliberation that in
itself suggested confidence.</p>

<p>Then the master went upstairs, with a light step, and stationed
himself at the window, wider and more perilous than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
any loophole, which overlooked the main door. It was the
post of greatest hazard, given him by his father in that make-believe
of defence which had preceded Sir Jasper&#8217;s riding-out.</p>

<p>Rupert glanced down at the six muskets, the powder flask,
the little heap of bullets that lay along the window-sill. &#8220;We
thought them nursery-toys, Simon?&#8221; he said, with his whimsical,
quick smile. &#8220;We even took the glass out from the
window, pretending that we must be ready for the sharp
attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drill pays,&#8221; growled Simon. &#8220;Aye, keep hard at it
enough, and drill pays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, faith pays&mdash;it is drill, as I told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith can bide. We&#8217;re here i&#8217; the stark murk of it, master,
and we&#8217;ll say our prayers to-morrow&mdash;if it happens we&#8217;re
alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert took up the muskets, one by one, saw to the priming
of them. &#8220;You&#8217;ll say your prayers to-night, Simon, by
getting to your post,&#8221; he said dryly. &#8220;Give Ben Shackleton
the loophole on the west side. That gives us three sides
guarded.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men went heavy-footed to their posts; and Shackleton
turned to Simon Foster when they were out of earshot.
&#8220;Young master&#8217;s fair uplifted,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He&#8217;s not fey&mdash;that&#8217;s
all I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not fey,&#8221; said Foster, blunt and full of common
sense. &#8220;He&#8217;s been a dreamer, and he&#8217;s wakened; and we
might do worse, Ben, than waken just as bright as he&#8217;s
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The master stood at his post, and felt the rebound from
his own high spirits. He looked out at the blurred moonlight,
the scattered flakes of snow, that hid the over-watching hills
from him. The old self-doubt returned. He was pledged
to keep the house secure&mdash;he who had been left behind because
he was not trained to join the Rising. And he had little
skill, except for dreams of high endeavour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>He lifted his head suddenly. From the courtyard below he
heard the hum of guttural voices. Goldstein and his men were
still gathered about the main doorway, hungry, wet to the
skin, irresolute as to the best plan of action.</p>

<p>Rupert was no dreamer now. He could see nothing in the
yard, through the thick snow and the moon-haze; but he took
up a musket and fired at random, and picked up a second gun,
and a third, and snapped the trigger; and from below there
came a yelp of pain, a running of men&#8217;s feet. And Rupert
was his own man again, forgetting dreams, remembering only
that the siege was here in earnest.</p>

<p>Through the smoke and the reek of gunpowder Nance Demaine
came into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my post?&#8221; she asked, standing trim and soldierly
at Rupert&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>Again she was met by the glance that looked through and
beyond her, as if she stood between Rupert and some settled
purpose. It seemed so short a while since she had sat at the
spinet, had seen his eyes hungry with her, as if she were all
his world; and now he scarcely heeded her. The riddle was
so easy for a man to guess, so hard for a woman; and Nance,
soldier-bred as she was, was piqued by the master&#8217;s grave,
single-minded outlook on the task in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your post, Nance?&#8221; he echoed. &#8220;With mother, away
from any chance of bullets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I shoot so badly, then&mdash;those days we practised up
the fields?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but this is men&#8217;s work, Nance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a garrison of three.&#8221; Some wayward humour,
some wish to hurt him, clouded all her usual kindliness. He
was strong and did not need her; and she missed something
pleasant that had threaded the weariness of these last days.
&#8220;There&#8217;s Simon, steady enough, but old. There is Ben
Shackleton. And there is&mdash;yourself, Rupert, very young to
musketry. Are you wise to refuse your last recruit?&#8221;</p>

<p>The taunt found its mark. This daughter of Squire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Roger&#8217;s had an odd power to touch the depths in him,
whether for pain or keen, unreasoning delight. A moment
since he had tasted happiness, had had no thought save one&mdash;that
he was master here, fighting an enemy of flesh and
blood at last. And now the old unrest crept in, the vague
self-distrust that had clouded earlier days.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re few, and have no skill,&#8221; he said, with an irony that
was stubborn and weary both; &#8220;but I was bred, Nance, to
put women in the background at these times.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him, as he stood in the cloudy moonlight
filtering through the window. She knew this tone of his so
well&mdash;knew that her hold on him was not weakened, after
all. &#8220;Oh, you were bred to that superstition?&#8221; she said
lightly. &#8220;As if women were ever in the background, Rupert!
Why, our business in life is to dance in front of you&mdash;always
a little in front of you, lest you capture us. Men,
so Lady Royd says, are merry until&mdash;until&mdash;they have us
safe in hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dropped him a curtsey; and, before he found an
answer, she was gone. And the master turned to the casement,
hoping for the sound of a footfall without, the chance
of another quick, haphazard shot. The wind had dropped to
a little, whining breeze; but there was no other sound about
this house that stood for the Stuart against odds. The snow
was thickening. Rupert watched the flakes settle on the window-sill,
ever a little faster, till a three-inch ridge was raised.
And the old trouble returned. This had been his life here&mdash;the
silence, the dumb abnegations, slow and cold in falling,
that had built a wall between himself and happiness. And
suddenly he brushed his hand sharply across the sill, scattering
the snow. It was his protest against the buried yesterdays.
Then he took up the three muskets he had fired, and
one by one reloaded them. And after that he waited.</p>

<p>An hour later Simon Foster, stiff already from standing at
the south window, made pretence that he must go the round
of the house, lest younger men were not steady at their posts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
As he hobbled down the corridor that led to the north side,
he saw Nance Demaine, sitting ghostlike at the window.
And he crossed himself, because the habits of fore-elders are
apt to cling to a man, however dim may be the faith of his
later years.</p>

<p>Nance turned. &#8220;Ah! you, Simon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s ye, Miss Nance? God forgive me, I thought you
a boggart, come to warn us the old house was tumbling
round our ears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet, Simon,&#8221; she said quietly. &#8220;I heard the master
say one side was unguarded&mdash;and I knew where the muskets
were stored&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Miss Nance, it&#8217;s no playing at shooting, this. It
may varry weel be a longer siege than you reckon for, and
we&#8217;re few; and it means sitting and waiting&mdash;waiting and
sitting&mdash;till ye&#8217;re sick for a wink o&#8217; sleep. Nay, nay! You
dunnot know what strength it needs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I nursed a sick child once&mdash;not long ago. For three
days and nights, Simon, I had no sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other was silent. All the countryside knew that story
now&mdash;knew how Squire Roger&#8217;s daughter had gone on some
casual errand of mercy to a cottage on the Demaine lands,
had found a feckless mother nursing a child far gone in fever,
had stayed on and fought for its life with skill and hard determination.
Yet Nance spoke of it now without thought
of any courage she had shown; she was eager only to prove
that she had a right to take her place among the men in
guarding Windyhough.</p>

<p>Simon Foster looked at the girl&#8217;s figure, the orderly line
of muskets. She seemed workmanlike; and he approved her
with a sudden, vigorous nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;The light&#8217;s dim, Miss Nance,&#8221; he growled, turning to
hobble down the corridor, &#8220;but I reckon ye can aim.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was so the long night began. The wind had ceased
altogether. From out of doors there was no sound, of man
or beast. The snow fell in thicker flakes, and, working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
silently as those concerned with burials do, it laid a shroud
about the courtyard, about the many gables of the house,
about the firs and leafless sycamores that guarded Windyhough
from the high moors.</p>

<p>On the north side of the house, where the stables and the
huddled mass of farm-buildings stood, Goldstein&#8217;s men were
preparing to find comfort for the night as best they could.
From time to time there was a sound of voices or of shuffling
footsteps, deadened by the snow; for the rest, a dismaying
stillness lay about the house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To Rupert, to Nance, guarding the north window, to
Simon Foster, this silence of attack seemed heavier, more unbearable,
than the do-nothing time that had preceded it.
There had been the brief battle-fury in the courtyard, the
zest of getting ready for the siege; and now there was only
silence and the falling snow.</p>

<p>And out of doors Goldstein was no less impatient. He
did not know that he was faced by a garrison so slender; for
there is a strength about a house that has shown one bold
front to attack, and afterwards gives no hint of the numbers
hidden by its walls. Already two were dead, and two badly
wounded, from among his company of one-and-twenty; and
the rest were hungry, body-sore, and in evil temper. It was
no time to force an entry. Better wait till daylight, get his
men out of gunshot, and find food for them somewhere in
the well-stocked farm-steadings.</p>

<p>They got round to the mistals on the west side of the
house&mdash;moving close along the walls, afraid of every window
that might hide a musket&mdash;and found Sir Jasper&#8217;s well-tended
cattle mooing softly to each other as they rattled their stall-chains.
The warm, lush smell of the byres suggested milk to
Goldstein, and, since stronger drink seemed out of reach, he
welcomed any liquor that might take the sharpest edge of
hunger from his men. He bade them milk the cows; and
into the midst of this tragic happening that had come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Windyhough there intruded a frank, diverting comedy, as the
way of life is. Not one of them had milked a cow before,
or guessed that Martha had been busy with her pail already;
but each thought it a simple matter, needing no more than a
man&#8217;s touch on the udders. They found a milking-stool abandoned
long ago by Martha because one leg was unstable, and
one by one they tried their luck. The first who tried was
kicked clean off the stool; the next man made a beginning so
foolish and unhandy that the roan cow looked back at him in
simple wonderment; and Goldstein, a better officer than his
men understood, welcomed the laughter and uproar that
greeted every misguided effort to fill the milking-pail. They
had not laughed once since Derby, these men who were getting
out of hand.</p>

<p>By and by the sport palled on them; and Goldstein, faced
once again by their hunger and unrest, found all his senses
curiously alert. From the laithe, next door to the byres, he
heard the bleating of sheep in-driven yesterday from the high
lands when the weather-wise were sure that snow was coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s food yonder, lads,&#8221; he said sharply. &#8220;Drink can
wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the laithe door, stood back a while from the
steam that greeted him&mdash;the oily heat of sheep close packed
together. The moonlight and the snow filtered in together
through the big, open doors as he ran forward, caught a ewe
by the neck, and dragged her out. And they dispatched her
quickly; for butchery came easy to their hands.</p>

<p>A little while after, as Rupert stood at his post by the window
overlooking the main door&mdash;waiting for something to
happen, as of old&mdash;he heard a slow, heavy footfall down the
corridor. A blurred figure of a man stood in the doorway&mdash;for
the moon&#8217;s light was dim and snowy&mdash;and the master
could only guess from the square, massive bulk who was this
night visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve lit a fire on the west side o&#8217; the house, master,&#8221;
came Shackleton&#8217;s big voice. &#8220;What it means I couldn&#8217;t tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
ye, but I saw the red of it go kitty-kelpy fair across the snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert followed him, glad already of the relief from sentry-work.
Across the west window&mdash;emptied of its glass, like
all the others, in readiness for action&mdash;little, pulsing shafts of
crimson were playing through the snow-flakes. They heard
men&#8217;s voices, confused and jarring; and the red glow
deepened, though they could see nothing of what was in the
doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t expect &#8217;em, like, to light their fire within
eye-shot,&#8221; said Shackleton, with his unalterable quiet; &#8220;it
would mean within gunshot, as we&#8217;ve taught &#8217;em. But I own
I&#8217;d like to know just what sort o&#8217; devilry they&#8217;re planning.
They might varry weel be firing the house over our heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the master. &#8220;There are only stone walls on
this side, Ben&mdash;five foot thick&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, true. But they&#8217;re not lads, to light a fire just for
the sake o&#8217; seeing it blaze.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside, close under shelter of the house-wall, Goldstein&#8217;s
men had carried straw from the laithe where it was stored,
had borrowed wood from the pile of timber left by Simon
Foster at the courtyard gate, and were roasting their sheep
as speedily as might be. And one adventurous spirit, searching
the outhouses with a patience born of thirst, had found
an unbroached ale-barrel. The return to good cheer loosened
the men&#8217;s tongues; and Goldstein was content to let them
have their way until this better mood of theirs had ripened.</p>

<p>Within doors, Simon Foster had heard the master and
Shackleton talking at the west window, had joined them, had
listened till, from the babel of many voices, he heard what
was in the doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re cooking their supper,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I should know
the way of it; for we went stark and wet through the &#8217;15,
and cooked many a fat sheep, we did, just like these unchancy
wastrels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Into their midst, none knowing how he had drifted there,
came Nat the shepherd, pipe in hand&mdash;a figure so old, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
palsied, that stronger men were moved by a pity deep as human
courage and human suffering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, now, I mind th&#8217; &#8217;15!&#8221; he cackled. &#8220;I rode out wi&#8217;
Sir Jasper&mdash;he was a lad i&#8217; those days, and me a mettlesome
man of fifty&mdash;and there were bonnie doings. It was all about
some business o&#8217; setting King Jamie on his throne&mdash;and there
were bonnie doings. The gentry riding in, and the gentry
riding out&mdash;and the bonnie ladies&#8217; een bo-peeping at them as
they went; and all the brave, open road ahead of us. We
shall see no such times again, I warrant.&#8221;</p>

<p>His head drooped suddenly. He fumbled for his tinder-box,
because in his enthusiasm for days gone by he had let
his pipe go out. He was a figure pitiful beyond belief&mdash;the
last, blown autumn leaf, it seemed, clinging to the wind-blown
tree of Stuart loyalty. And the master, in spite of the
hazard out of doors, halted for a word of compassion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did well, Nat,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;Tell us how the
&#8217;15 went.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat was silent for a while. Across his dotage, across the
memories that were food and drink to him, he returned to
present-day affairs. He looked closely at the master, and
nodded sagely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re varry like your father, Maister Rupert. It seems
a pity, like, you should be left here, to die like a ratten in a
trap, when you might have been crying Tally-Ho along the
Lunnon road.&#8221;</p>

<p>The master winced. &#8220;They&#8217;ve not trapped us yet,&#8221; he
said quietly. &#8220;Get down to the inglenook, Nat, and smoke
your pipe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; said Shackleton, his ear turned to the window.
&#8220;They&#8217;re getting merry out yonder. Begom! they must have
found liquor somewhere, to go singing out o&#8217; doors on a
stark night like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>A full-throated chorus was sounding now across the snow
and the dancing red of the fire. The words were German, but
the lilt of them was not to be mistaken.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>&#8220;I wish I&#8217;d known they were coming,&#8221; said Simon Foster
ruefully. &#8220;There was a barrel of ale, master, left i&#8217; the
shippon because I was too lazy to get it indoors yesterday.
And they&#8217;ve broached it, they have; and it&#8217;s good liquor going
down furrin throats. The waste o&#8217; decent stuff!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert listened to the uproar out of doors. He had a quick
imagination, and he was picturing an attack by drunken
soldiery. These men of Goldstein&#8217;s, he had gathered, were
not lambs when sober. He thought of Nance, of his mother&mdash;thought
of the virile, tender love that men of his Faith give
their women&mdash;and the soul of him caught fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shackleton,&#8221; he said sharply, &#8220;keep your post. Simon,
get to yours. And, by the God who made me, I&#8217;ll shoot you
if you sleep to-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not see Nance, nor think of her, as he went to his
own station overlooking the main door. But Nance heard
his tread, and glanced up, and found the night emptier because
he did not know that she was near. For men and
women see life from opposite sides of the same hill, and
always will until hereafter they find themselves standing on
the same free, windy summit.</p>

<p>He went to his post, and the long night settled down.
And nothing happened, as of old. From sheer need of occupation,
he fell to watching the snow fall thick and thicker
out of doors&mdash;tried to count the flakes&mdash;and found the dumb,
unceasing crowd of them enticing him to sleep. And then
he sought a better remedy. He remembered the man he had
hit through the opening of the courtyard gate&mdash;the others
who had fallen to his musket; and he found the odd zest, the
call of future peril, which spring from action. And to Rupert
the call came with a peculiar sharpness; for he had been
accounted slight, a scholar, and he was here in the thick of
the siege perilous, with a deed or two standing already to
his credit.</p>

<p>He was used from of old to sleeplessness, and as the night
wore on his spirits rose to a surprising gaiety and sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
well-being. His garrison was small; but he was master of
his own house, at long last, and he had powder and ball on
the window-sill in front of him. Whether he lived or died
mattered little; but it was of prime importance that he kept
this house of Windyhough to the last edge of his strength.</p>

<p>Out of doors, Captain Goldstein had given up all thoughts
of prosecuting the siege until the dawn. He had detached
six men from the ale-barrel to play sentry round the house,
and had got the rest into shelter of the outhouses a half-hour
later. They were bone-tired, all of them; they were well fed
and full of ale; and the beds they made for themselves, of
hay and straw, seemed soft as eider-down. Only Goldstein
kept awake. He was as weary as any of them; but he had a
single purpose, as Rupert had. The Prince was in the house
here; dead or alive, he stood for thirty thousand pounds; and
Goldstein kept himself awake by picturing the life he would
enjoy, out yonder in the Fatherland, when he had claimed
his share of the reward. He would squander a thousand of
the thirty among his men&mdash;more or less, according to their
temper&mdash;and would afterwards retire from service. For
Goldstein, it would seem, did not share the Catholic belief
that, till he dies, no man is privileged to retire from soldiery.</p>

<p>He kept awake; and by and by he could not rest under
shelter of the byre that kept him weather-tight. He went out
into the snowy moonlight, intent on seeing that his sentries
were leaving no way open for the Prince to escape; and he
forgot that there were windows looking out at him.</p>

<p>Rupert was standing at his post meanwhile, finding his high
dreams useful now that the call to arms had come. He was
serving for faith&#8217;s sake, and for loyalty&#8217;s; and service of
that sort is apt to breed an odd content.</p>

<p>Across his sense of well-being a gunshot sounded&mdash;quick,
and loud, and urgent, in this house of silence. He took up
a musket, and peered through the snow-storm out of doors,
expecting an assault. And again nothing happened, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
little while. And then he heard a woman&#8217;s step along the
corridor, and Nance&#8217;s voice, low and piteous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rupert, where are you? I&mdash;I need you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then Rupert learned afresh, with a vivid pain that
seemed unbearable, how deep his love had gone during the
past, silent years. She was in trouble, and needed him. He
ran to her side, but could not outstrip the fears that crowded
round him. There was the gunshot&mdash;and she was hurt;
Nance, whom he had longed to keep from the least touch of
harm, was hurt.</p>

<p>He put his arms about her. His eyes had grown used long
since to the dim moonlight of the room, and they sought with
feverish concern for traces of her wound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you hurt, Nance?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>And &#8220;Here,&#8221; she said, with a wan little smile&mdash;&#8220;here,
right through my heart, Rupert. I&mdash;I have killed a man, I
think, just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then, through the confusion of his thoughts, he remembered
that the gunshot had sounded from within doors, and
his heart grew lighter. &#8220;Why, then, there&#8217;s one less of the
enemy. You should be proud, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Proud?&#8221; Her voice was still and hushed. &#8220;You were
right when you said that this was man&#8217;s work. I was watching
at the north window&mdash;and the time seemed long in passing&mdash;and
then I saw a man&#8217;s thick-set body coming through the
snow. And I&mdash;I forgot I was a woman, and took aim, and
he fell, Rupert, so suddenly, with his arms thrown up, and
lay there in the snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One less,&#8221; said the master, with a return to dogged cheerfulness.
&#8220;We must get to our posts again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance looked at him. Now that he knew her safe, he was
again the soldier, forgetting the way of his heart and thinking
only of the need for action. And her pride took fire, as she
went back to her window, resolute to show him that she could
be soldierly as he. For a while she dared not look out, remembering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
what lay yonder; and then she chided herself for
cowardice, and peeped through the moonlight.</p>

<p>The huddled bulk of a man that had lain prone in the snow
was moving now&mdash;slowly, and on hands and knees&mdash;and was
creeping out of range. And once again Nance knew herself
a woman; for she was glad, with a joy instant and
vehement, that she had a wounded man only on her conscience.</p>

<p>Goldstein, when the shot hit him at close range, had thought
the end had come. He was wearied out by long riding over
broken roads, by need of sleep; and the flare of the gunshot,
the sudden hell-fire in his left thigh, had knocked his hardiness
to bits. But by and by, when he found leisure to pick
his courage up, and knew that his wound went only deep
through the fleshy part of his thigh, he made his way back
to the stables, and roused one of his sleeping troopers; and,
between them, they staunched the bleeding, and dressed the
wound with odds and ends torn from the linings of their
coats. And then Goldstein lay back on the straw and slept
like a little child, and dreamed that he was home again in
Hanover, in the days before he sought advancement in a
foreign country.</p>

<p>At Will Underwood&#8217;s house, meanwhile, the laggard gentry
of Lancashire were sitting over their wine, and were cursing
this snowfall that would not let them hunt to-morrow. And
they were troubled, all of them; for they knew that better
men were facing hardship on the London road, while they,
from faults of sloth or caution, were sheltered by house-walls.
They were men, after all, under the infirmities that
hindered them; and ease, for its own sake, never yet appealed
for long to hearts built for weather and adventure. They
needed hard exercise, to blunt the edge of conscience; and they
were fretful, ready to pick quarrels among themselves, because
they knew that the morrow must be spent in idleness.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can always drink, gentlemen,&#8221; said Underwood, pushing
the bottle round. &#8220;That is one consolation.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>&#8220;Likely to be our only one,&#8221; snapped his neighbour, &#8220;if
this cursed snow stays on the ground. And we can drink
half the night, Underwood&mdash;but not all the day as well. You
can have too much of a pastime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they doing London way, I wonder?&#8221; put in
a smooth-faced youngster, gibing at himself and all of them.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll have bonnie roads to travel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Underwood remembered a day, not long ago, when he had
met Nance Demaine on the moor, recalled the look in her face
as she gave him her kerchief and bade him use it as a
flag of truce &#8220;when her men returned from the crowning.&#8221;
He got to his feet and reached across the table with clenched
fist. &#8220;How dare you!&#8221; he said savagely. &#8220;We&#8217;re all wearing
the white feather, and you twit us with it, you young
fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>They drew back from him for a moment. His pain and fury
were so evident, his easy-going temper so completely broken,
that they thought him drunk, when in reality he was vastly
sober&mdash;so sobered that he saw himself a creature pitiful and
time-serving.</p>

<p>And the youngster, taking fire in turn, said that he would
be called fool by no man without asking satisfaction; and
swords would have been out had not Underwood&#8217;s neighbour,
a jolly, red-faced squire who liked to drink his wine in peace,
taken the situation at a canter.</p>

<p>&#8220;For shame, Underwood!&#8221; he said, laying a sharp hand
on his shoulder. &#8220;It would be no duel&mdash;it would be another
slaughter of the innocents. To fight a boy like that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very innocent, by your leave,&#8221; broke in the youngster,
with such palpable affront, such pride in his budding
vices, that the old squire laughed outrageously.</p>

<p>&#8220;By gad! not very innocent!&#8221; he echoed, with another
rolling laugh. &#8220;See the cockrel standing up to crow&mdash;all red
about the gills, gentlemen. Let&#8217;s fill our glasses and drink to
his growing comb.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it ended in frank laughter as they rose and drowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the quarrel in a roaring toast. But Underwood, though he
joined them, carried no good look. He was still thinking of
Nance Demaine, of the white badge she had offered him.
And an uneasy silence settled on them all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard a queer tale to-day, Will,&#8221; said the red-faced
squire presently, by way of lifting the talk into easier channels.
&#8220;Old Luke Faweather met me on the road. He was
coming home from market on that fat, piebald horse of his,
and he pulled up. He&#8217;d ridden wide of Windyhough, it
seemed, and swore that he heard gunshots through the snow&mdash;rattle
after rattle, he said, as if half the moorside were letting
off their guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Luke!&#8221; laughed Underwood, rousing himself from
his evil mood. &#8220;We know his market-days. He hears and
sees queer things at home-coming&mdash;carries the bottle in his
head, as the saying goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, but he seemed his own man to-day. The horse
wasn&#8217;t guiding him for once. His wife had been at him,
maybe. He said they were not firing fowling-pieces, but
something &#8216;lustier in the bellows,&#8217; and I could make neither
head nor tail of it. Who at Windyhough would be playing
Guy Fawkes&#8217; foolery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rupert, likely,&#8221; growled Underwood, some old jealousy
aroused. &#8220;He was all for joining this precious Rising, till
he found they had no use for dreamers. He was left to play
nursery games with the women, and grew tired of it, and
rummaged through the house till he found the muskets stored
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well, Underwood; but the lad would not
go firing into the snow just for the frolic of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t he? I know Rupert. He could dream a whole
regiment of enemies into the courtyard there if his mind were
set that way, and go on firing at the ghosts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s past my understanding,&#8221; laughed the squire.
&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can see him,&#8221; Underwood went on, old antipathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
gaining on him. &#8220;He&#8217;s ambitious. He would like to be the
martyred Charles, and the Prince, and every cursed Stuart of
them all. It&#8217;s laughable to think how much our scholar
dares&mdash;in fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>A low growl went round the table, and Underwood knew
that he had gone too far.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be a duel in earnest soon,&#8221; sputtered the red-faced
squire who loved his ease. &#8220;You were never one of
us, Will Underwood&mdash;and you think we&#8217;re birds of a feather
because we stayed at home with you; but I tell you plainly,
I&#8217;ll listen to no slur on a Stuart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I spoke hastily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did&mdash;and you&#8217;ll recant!&#8221;</p>

<p>Underwood, tired of himself and all things, gathered something
of his old, easy manner. He filled his glass afresh
and lifted it, and passed it with finished bravado over the jug
in front of him. &#8220;To the King across the water, gentlemen!&#8221;
he said smoothly.</p>

<p>One of the company had gone to the window, and turned
now from looking out on the snow that never ceased. &#8220;All
this does not help us much,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;We can talk and
talk, and drink pretty-boy toasts till we&#8217;re under the table;
but what of to-morrow? There&#8217;ll be nothing doing out of
doors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said Will Underwood. &#8220;When the snow&#8217;s tired
of falling there&#8217;ll be frost; and the wild duck&mdash;say, to-morrow
night&mdash;will be coming over Priest&#8217;s Tarn, up above Windyhough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gad! that is a happy notion, Will!&#8221; assented the old
squire. &#8220;It&#8217;s years since I had a shot at duck in the moonlight&mdash;and
rare sport it is. Come, we&#8217;ve drunk to the Stuart,
and to every lady we could call to mind. Let&#8217;s fill afresh,
and drink to the wild duck flying high.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will was glad when the night&#8217;s revelry ended and he found
himself alone in the dining-hall. He had drunk level with
his friends, and the wine had left him untouched. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
diced with them, sung hunting-songs, and no spark of gaiety
had reached him. For, day by day since he lost Nance once
for all, he had been learning how deep his love had gone.
Looking back to-night, as he sat at the littered table, with its
empty bottles and its wine-stains, he could not understand how
he had come to be absent from the Loyal Meet. The meaner
side of him was hidden away. He was a man carrying a love
bigger than himself&mdash;a love that would last him till he died;
and he had not known as much until these days of loss and
misery came.</p>

<p>At Windyhough the night wore slowly on. The besiegers,
since Goldstein crept into shelter, spent and disabled, were
less disposed than ever to risk attack before the daylight gave
them clearer knowledge of this house that seemed to have a
musket behind every window. The besieged listened to the
silence&mdash;the silence of expectancy, which grows so deep and
burdensome that a man can almost hear it. From time to time
Rupert went the round of the corridor to see that his garrison
was wakeful, and about the middle of the night he found
Ben Shackleton nodding at his post, and gripped him by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s to do?&#8221; growled the farmer, shaking his big bulk
like a dog whistled out of the water. &#8220;I was dreaming, master,
and as nigh heaven as a man ever gets i&#8217; this life. I&#8217;d
have swopped farming and wife and all for one more blessed
hour of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert laughed. He was learning much of human to-and-froing
during these last days, and his first hot contempt of
this sleeping sentry yielded to a broader sympathy. &#8220;What
was your dream, Ben?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, naught so much&mdash;only that I went to Lancashire
Market and had a pig to sell. She wasn&#8217;t worth what I was
asking, not by th&#8217; half. And t&#8217;other chap he wrangled, and I
wrangled; then, blamed if the fool didn&#8217;t gi&#8217;e me what I asked,
and we were just wetting our whistles on th&#8217; bargain when
ye wakened me. It was a terrible good dream, master.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>&#8220;Well, stay awake to remember it, Ben. These folk outside
are too quiet for my liking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben&#8217;s face was impassive as ever, but his glance measured
Rupert from heel to crown. He saw a slim-bodied man,
whose face was lit with a keen and happy fire; he saw, too,
that the anxiety which had dulled even Lady Royd&#8217;s eyes&mdash;the
toast of the county still, though the eyes were middle-aged&mdash;had
only strengthened the light of authority and strength
which played about his face. Ben Shackleton was slow to
awake from his dream of pig-selling, but he was aware of
some settled gladness&mdash;gladness that Sir Jasper had an heir at
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; he said, shaking himself afresh. &#8220;It&#8217;s the honest
dog that barks&mdash;the biting sort lie quiet. Well, then?
What&#8217;s afoot, maister? I&#8217;m here to take my orders, I reckon,
as Blacksmith Dan said when parson asked him if he&#8217;d have
Mary o&#8217; Ghyll to be his wedded wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s lazy tongue, his steadfastness, proved long ago,
brought an odd peace to Rupert. There were snow and a
bitter wind outside, and an enemy that only by convention
could be named civilised; but within there was a little garrison
whose members, on the great, main issues, were not divided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You are here to obey orders,&#8221; said the other
sharply. &#8220;Keep awake at your post, Ben.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shackleton saluted gravely. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it for ye, master,
though I had a busyish day before I rade hither-till, getting
ewes down from the high lands&mdash;and sleep is sticking round
me fair like a bramble-thicket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve to win through the thicket, Ben,&#8221; said the
master, and passed on.</p>

<p>He crossed to the north window, saw Nance standing there,
her trim head lifted to the moonlight as she peered over the
window-sill; and for a moment he forgot that they were in
the thick of the siege perilous.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he said, with the tenderest simplicity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
&#8220;you&#8217;d best get to bed. You have done enough for one
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not turn her head, and her voice was cold. &#8220;Have
<i>you</i> done enough, Rupert?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m used to lack of sleep, and you are not.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thought of the wakeful nights that had been torture
to her since Will Underwood returned. First love, built of
the stuff she had given him, dies hard; for it is the weak
things that find easy death-beds, because their grip on this
life and hereafter is languid and of slight account.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can handle a musket,&#8221; she said, turning with sharp defiance;
&#8220;and our defence is&mdash;is not strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the silence, across the dull moonlight of the corridor,
they measured each other with a long glance. And Nance,
in this mood of hers, was passionately at war with him. Until
to-day he had been her bond-slave, gay when she willed
it, foolish and out of heart when she flouted him. And now
her reign was ended. Rupert did not know it yet; but Nance,
with the intuition that seems to do women little service, was
aware that she had lost for the time being a cavalier and
found instead a master.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can handle a musket,&#8221; he said dryly. &#8220;Good-night,
Nance&mdash;and remember to keep your head low above the sill.
The men outside can aim straight, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went back to his post at the window overlooking the
main door. And he began to think of Nance, of the brown,
shapely head that had been magic to him&mdash;the head that was
in danger of a bullet from one of Goldstein&#8217;s men. Yesterday
he would have gone to her side, to ease the fierce pain for
her safety; his feet were willing, and he wondered that instead
he stood obstinately at his post, intent on musketry and
the welfare of his house.</p>

<p>Nance waited for his return. She had had him at call, until
peril came and the attack in front. She was sure that he
would come back, anxious as of old lest the world should
use her ill. But he did not come; and she felt oddly desolate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
because he was so resolute and far away from her. Then
she, too, turned to the moonlit window and to soldiery.</p>

<p>And the night crept on to dawn. From the fowl-yard at
the rear of the house a cock began to crow half-heartedly.
Nance, from her window, and the master of the house from
his, looked out on a grey whirl of snow, reddened by the fingers
of a frosty dawn.</p>

<p>And nothing happened, as the way had been these days at
Windyhough.</p>

<small>THE NEED OF SLEEP</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Goldstein</span>, when he awoke the next morning to find himself
laid on the stable straw with a dull ache in his left thigh, remembered
the business that had brought him here, and tried
to rise. He found himself sick and useless, and, getting to
his feet by sheer hardihood, fell back again with a black mist
about his eyes. Little by little he began to accept the situation
as it stood, and he waited till his head was fairly clear
again. He did not propose, so long as he had breath, to
abandon his project of securing the blood-money that would
secure him a life of ease in the Fatherland; and his troopers,
when he gave his commands for the day with brisk precision,
liked him better, seeing his pluck, than they had done since
the beginning of this ill-starred errand. He reminded them,
moreover, of their slain, lying here and there about the courtyard;
and revenge is a fire that kindles men&#8217;s courage and
hard obstinacy.</p>

<p>A little while later, as Rupert peered through the dawn-red
snow of the courtyard, he heard a gruff voice from below.
It was the sergeant&#8217;s who was Goldstein&#8217;s deputy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to come within gunshot of your window,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every man to his taste,&#8221; laughed Rupert, glad of any
respite from his vigil. &#8220;If you need lead, I can entertain
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Under truce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be no truce. I hold my house for the King,
and mean to keep it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But listen. Give us the Pretender&mdash;we know as well as
you do that he&#8217;s hiding here&mdash;and the rest of you can pass
out in safety.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>&#8220;The Prince is here you think? Why, then, we guard
him, sir&mdash;what else is possible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not give five minutes&#8217; truce? Captain Goldstein
is wounded&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m devilish glad to hear it,&#8221; said Rupert, with the gaiety
that would not be denied.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sends me to talk over this little matter of the siege.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then step out into the open&mdash;under truce&mdash;and let me
see your face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some quality of honour in Rupert&#8217;s voice reached the sergeant.
As he put it to himself, he knew the man for a
fool who kept his word. The snow had all but ceased for a
while, and in the keen dawnlight Goldstein&#8217;s man looked up
and saw Rupert&#8217;s grave, clean-cut face at the window overhead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your garrison is weak. We know it,&#8221; said the sergeant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You lie. Our garrison is strong,&#8221; Rupert answered
bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How strong?&#8221; put in the other, trying clumsily to catch
him unawares.</p>

<p>&#8220;Force your way in and learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely we can drive a bargain? There&#8217;s a price on
the Pretender&#8217;s head&mdash;a trifle of thirty thousand pounds&mdash;and
you can share it with us, if you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden loathing came to Rupert as he listened to the
man&#8217;s thick, guttural persuasiveness. These hired soldiery
of the enemy seemed to have only two views of a man&mdash;that
he could be bullied or be bought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back to Captain Goldstein,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Tell him that
we&#8217;re strong to stand a siege, and that&mdash;we are gentlemen of
Lancashire who hold the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant glanced narrowly at the face above, and a suspicion
took sudden hold of him. This man with the disdainful,
easy air might be the Prince himself. He remembered
the condition &#8220;dead or alive&#8221; attached to the blood-money,
lifted his carbine, and fired point blank. The ball went wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
a little; but for a moment Rupert thought that he was hit, as
the splintered masonry cut across his forehead. Then he
stooped, picked up a musket, and took flying aim at the man
below&mdash;without avail, as he thought. It would have cheered
him to see the sergeant limp round the corner of the house
toward the stables.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Goldstein, cursing the pain that touched
him as he moved quickly round. &#8220;Did the young rebel come
to terms?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He came to the butt-end of a musket against his shoulder,
and the bullet grazed my knee. I shall limp for days to
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then limp, you fool! What is a grazed knee with the
Pretender indoors yonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen the Pretender,&#8221; said the other, getting out his
pipe and filling it. &#8220;The young rebel, as you call him&mdash;the
man who pretends to be Sir Jasper&#8217;s son&mdash;is Charlie Stuart.
Face, and big, careless air, and belief that truce means truce
in wartime&mdash;he&#8217;s Charlie to the life, the Charlie who got as
far as Derby and then, with all before him, went back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Goldstein, with nothing to do except nurse his wound, had
been thinking much the same, had been reckoning up, too,
the chances of this enterprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re weak in numbers,&#8221; he said by and by.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure. They&#8217;re quick enough to fire from all
four sides of the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but the Stuart whelp would have led a sortie before
this if they&#8217;d been strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; growled the sergeant, old at campaigning. &#8220;How
long shall we give them, Captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A day or two. See to the sentries, keep out of fire, and
we&#8217;ll see what the waiting-time will do for them. It&#8217;s a devil&#8217;s
game, waiting for action that never comes&mdash;we learned that,
Randolph, in the old Flanders days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, we learned fear,&#8221; said the sergeant, harking back
to some lonely enterprises that he had shared with Goldstein.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>Within doors Rupert kept his post. The brief excitement
of his skirmish with the sergeant was gone. His fancy,
always active, was racing now. He pictured, with a minuteness
painful in its vividness, the shrift his women-folk would
meet at the hands of the enemy without. Men who could
not honour a truce of their own asking differed little from the
brutes. And he was almost single-handed here, the master
of a garrison so small that it was laughable.</p>

<p>The snow, after an hour or so, began to fall again. And
round about the house there was a silence that could be felt.
Those who have played sentry, hoping constantly for the relief
of action, know the stealthy, evil fears that creep into a
man&#8217;s mind, know the crude, imminent temptation that sleep
offers them, know the persuasive devil at their elbow who
asks them why they take this trouble for a cause lost already.</p>

<p>All that day there was silence and the falling snow. And
all night there was silence, broken only by a little wind that
sobbed about the house; and Goldstein and the sergeant, nursing
their wounds in the stable, could have told Rupert every
symptom of the malady from which he suffered. They had
gone through it years ago.</p>

<p>Lady Royd, for her part, showed bright against the dull
canvas of the siege. She discovered, in her own haphazard
way, that years of communion with Sir Jasper had taught her
courage when the pinch of danger came. She still kept her
pampered spaniel under her arm; but, in between the sleep she
snatched fitfully, she moved about the house as the mistress
and great lady. She kept up the flagging spirits of the
women-servants, saw that the men had food and wine to keep
their strength alive. And, now and then, she stole into the
room overlooking the main door, and stood watching her son&mdash;bone
of her bone&mdash;keep steady at his post. And afterwards
she would withdraw, a happiness like starshine going
with her because the heir, despite her weak handling of his
destiny, was after all a man.</p>

<p>The next day broke with keen frost and a red sun that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
forced its way through the last cloudbanks of the snow. And
the sergeant asked Goldstein for his orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em wait,&#8221; grinned Goldstein. &#8220;We know the game,
Randolph, eh? Let &#8217;em wait till nightfall. Change sentries
every two hours. It&#8217;s devilish cold, and we must humour our
ill-licked cubs. And, Randolph&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, thirty thousand pounds are worth the waiting
for.&#8221;</p>

<p>The master of Windyhough still kept his post; but, as the
day wore on, he knew that he was facing disastrous odds.
Across his eyes sleep began to weave slim and filmy cobwebs.
He brushed them savagely away; but a moment later the hidden
enemy was once again at work. It was a warfare as
stealthy as this fight between the garrison, sheltered by stout
walls, and the besiegers, who could not gauge the strength
of those within.</p>

<p>For his health&#8217;s sake, the master went the round of the
house, found Ben Shackleton frankly asleep at the west window,
and Simon Foster nodding, half-befogged with weariness.
He roused them&mdash;not gently&mdash;and the struggle to stir
them into watchfulness cleared all the cobwebs from his
eyes.</p>

<p>He went back to his post by way of the north window;
and here again he found his sentry fast asleep. Nance was
sitting on the chair that Lady Royd had brought her, earlier
in the day. Her brown hair was loosened in a cloud, and her
face was hidden in her two capable, small hands. She had
been a sentry to him&mdash;no more, no less, since the fiercest of
this siege commanded all his ruggedness and strength; but
he had no wish to rouse her now.</p>

<p>The waning light showed him the bowed figure, the tiredness
that had conquered her persistent courage. He drew
nearer, touched her bowed head with some stifling war of
passion against reverence. All the muddled way of his love
for her&mdash;the love that had not dared, because he doubted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
own strength to claim her&mdash;was swept aside. At the heart
of him&mdash;the big, eager heart that had found no room till now&mdash;he
knew himself a man. With the strength of his manhood
he needed her, here in the midst of the siege perilous, needed
to tell her of his love.</p>

<p>He moved forward, checked himself, watched the figure
that was bent by a vigil too burdensome and long-protracted.
And the wildness left him. The faith that had grown with
his growing&mdash;the faith that had shown signs, a little while
ago, of wear and tear&mdash;laid a cool, persuasive hand on him.
Through the storm and trouble of this love for Nance he saw
that she was weak, and wearied-out, and needing sleep. And
at such times to the stalwart men a little light, reflected, may
be, from the Madonna&#8217;s face, shows like a shrouded star
about all suffering women.</p>

<p>Rupert was finding the big love, and the lasting, here in
the silence that tested faith and courage more than any fury
of attack and open peril. He went back to his window. And
again sleep tried to spin her cobwebs round his eyes; but her
blandishments were idle.</p>

<p>The snow, about three of the afternoon, ceased falling, and
across the moors that guarded Windyhough a wild splendour
lit the hills. The clouds were scattered, till the last of them
trailed over Lone Man&#8217;s Hill in smoky mist. The sun lay
red and fiery on the western spurs, and from the east the
young moon rose, her face clean-washed and radiant. Frost
settled keen and hard about the land, and all the white emptiness
of snow grew full of sparkling life, as if some fairy had
gone sowing diamonds broadcast.</p>

<p>At Will Underwood&#8217;s house, five miles away across the
heath, the feckless men who had shirked the Rising, took
heart again. The duck-shooting that Will had promised them
had miscarried yesterday, because the snow declined to humour
them; but there would be sport to-night. Civil war,
arising suddenly, brings always strange medleys, and it seemed
unbelievable that these gentry could be here, quietly discussing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the prospects of their moonlight shooting, while the house
that was nearest neighbour to Underwood was standing, unknown
to them, a siege against long odds. For Windyhough
lay isolated, high up the moors that were untravelled by
chance wayfarers during this rough weather; it was circled
by rolling hills that caught the crack of muskets, and played
with the uproar, passing it on from spur to spur, until it
reached the outer world as a dull, muffled sound that had no
meaning to the sharpest ears.</p>

<p>Rupert did not ask aid, would have resented any. And, as
the day wore on to seven o&#8217;clock&mdash;ticked out solemnly by the
great clock in the hall&mdash;he was fighting, with surprising gaiety
and patience, the battle against silence and the foe without.
His eyes were not misty now with sleep. His mind was clear,
unhurried, fixed on a single purpose; and, when now and then
he made his round of the house, his body seemed light and
supple in the going, as if he trod on air. He was possessed,
indeed, by that dangerous, keen strength known to runners
and night-riders as second wind.</p>

<p>One of Goldstein&#8217;s sentries, patrolling the front of the
house, chose this moment for a fool&#8217;s display of confidence.
The house was so silent, the strain on the endurance of the
garrison so heavy, that he thought them all asleep within
doors, and came out into the open to reconnoitre.</p>

<p>Rupert saw him creep, a dark splash against the frosty
snow, and levelled his musket sharply. In this mood of clear
vision and clear purpose, he could not have missed his aim;
and the sentry dropped, as a bullock does when the pole-axe
strikes his forehead.</p>

<p>And then there was a sound of hurried feet across the yard,
and another sentry came to see what was in the doing. And a
second musket-shot ran out</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Rupert?&#8221; came a low, troubled voice from
the doorway.</p>

<p>He turned and saw Nance standing there, roused by the
shots, but still only half awake. Not again, perhaps, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
he taste the exquisite, unheeding joy, the sense of self-command,
that held him now.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two less, my dear,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She had been dreaming of old days and new, during the
vigil at the north window that had proved too long for her;
and she spoke as a child does, half between sleep and waking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you came to me, Rupert, and you held me close,
because there was danger, and you told me you were proved
at long last. I always trusted you to show them&mdash;how big a
Stuart heart you had.&#8221;</p>

<p>The master glanced at her. She was good to see, with the
brown, disordered hair that clouded a face soft with sleep
and tenderness. And yet he was impatient, as he touched
her hand, led her back to her seat under the north window,
watched her yield again to the sleep that would not be denied.
Then he went to his post; and all the new-found passion
in him, all his zest in life, were centred on the strip of
snowy courtyard that lay about the great main door. He was
captain of this enterprise, and till the siege was raised he
asked no easier road of blandishment.</p>

<p>For the next hour there was quiet, except that Martha,
the dairymaid, came upstairs with heavy tread; and, when
the master went out to learn what was in the doing, he found
her setting down a steaming dish on Simon Foster&#8217;s knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were always one for your victuals,&#8221; she was saying
tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; assented Simon cheerily. &#8220;An empty sack never
stands up, they say; and who am I to deny it? You&#8217;ve a
knowledgable way of handling a man, Martha.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re all I have, Simon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that willun&#8217;t be much to boast of, if this plaguy quiet
goes on much longer. I&#8217;m fair moiled wi&#8217; weariness, my
lass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert saw the man, who should have learned riper wisdom
by this time, bring down Martha&#8217;s head to the level of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
his own; and he went back to his window, filled with a deep,
friendly merriment. And still he trod on air, not knowing
how near he lay to the sleep that would not be denied.</p>

<p>And by and by, as he looked out in constant hope that
another figure would come stealing into the moonlit open, he
heard his mother&#8217;s spaniel barking from the far side of the
house. The dog had heard, though the master&#8217;s duller ears
could not, the voices raised in sharp discussion in the stable-yard.
News had been brought to Goldstein that the house
was resolute and wide-awake, if two dead men from among
his lessening band were proof enough; and the pain of his
wound roughened his impatience; and he gave certain orders
that were to the liking of his troopers, chilled by harsh
weather and inaction.</p>

<p>A little later Rupert heard a woman&#8217;s step again along the
corridor and the pampered crying of a dog. Lady Royd, all
in her night gear, with a wrap thrown loosely over it, came
into the moonlight of the room, carrying the spaniel underarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rupert, my little dog is restless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother? It&#8217;s an old habit with him. You feed
him in season and out. No wonder he has nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never liked him, I know,&#8221; she complained.</p>

<p>He was gentle with her petulance. Her face was stained
with weariness and fear; she needed him. On all hands he
was needed these last days; and the strength of him went out,
buoyantly, to each new call made on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must like him for your sake, mother,&#8221; he answered
lightly.</p>

<p>The spaniel slipped suddenly from Lady Royd&#8217;s grasp, ran
barking to the window, and jumped on to the sill. All seemed
quiet without, but the dog barked furiously, and would not be
quieted.</p>

<p>Then from the courtyard a musket cracked. The bullet
missed the spaniel, went droning through the room, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
touched Lady Royd&#8217;s cheek in passing. She did not heed,
but ran and clutched her dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;My little man!&#8221; she murmured, with tender foolery.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not hurt? The wicked men, to shoot at a wee
doggie&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not hurt,&#8221; said Rupert sharply; &#8220;but you are,
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>She touched her cheek, looked at the crimson on her finger.
And she was the great lady once again. &#8220;Rupert, a
wasp has stung me,&#8221; she said, in her dainty, well-bred voice&mdash;&#8220;a
rebel wasp. You will destroy the hive.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the master laughed, seeing she was little hurt. This
mother of his was a Royd among them, after all. She had
not thought of danger as she snatched her spaniel from the
window, had not winced when the bullet seared her cheek.
In the quiet, royal way, she gave her quarrel into his hands
and trusted him to take it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s agate, master?&#8221; asked Simon Foster, coming in
to learn the meaning of the musket-shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you, Simon. All was quiet outside&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if the dog heard something,&#8221; said the other shrewdly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s sharper ears than you or me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted his head cautiously above the sill and listened.
There was silence absolute in the courtyard, and within doors
only the tick-tack of the eight-day clock in the hall, the whimpering
of the spaniel. Whatever Goldstein&#8217;s project had
been, it was delayed by the dog&#8217;s unexpected challenge.</p>

<p>Simon scented danger on this side of the house, however,
and would not get back to his post. And a half-hour later
his patience was rewarded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess what they&#8217;re at,&#8221; he said, turning with a slow
grin. &#8220;My lady&mdash;meaning no disrespect&mdash;you&#8217;d best keep
your lile dog&#8217;s tongue still, or he&#8217;ll spoil our sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Royd was learning obedience these days. &#8220;Are they
your orders, Rupert?&#8221; she said submissively.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, mother, yes. Get back to your warm room. You&#8217;ll
take a chill out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned at the door, glanced at him with a whimsical,
queer air of raillery. &#8220;You men are built after the one pattern.
You need us women till there&#8217;s something worth while
in the doing, and then&mdash;why, then, my dear, you send us
straight to bed, like naughty children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We keep you out of harm&#8217;s way, mother. Good-night,&#8221;
said Rupert gravely. &#8220;What do you hear, Simon?&#8221; he
asked the moment she was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men creeping through the snow; I can hear their feet
scrunching over the frozen crust; and they&#8217;re dragging
branches after them. I was a fool not to listen to the women-folk
when they asked me to get in yond cartload of fuel I
left just outside the gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The master understood at last. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be firing the main
door?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just that. And there&#8217;s straw in plenty, and the stack o&#8217;
bracken we got in last autumn, and a barrel of tar left over
from the spring. They&#8217;ve got it all ready to their hands,
master.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of it,&#8221; said Rupert, with the keen, unerring foresight
bred of the vigil he had kept.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh? And for why, if a plain body might ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because another night of this would find us fast asleep,
Simon. I have had to wake you once or twice already, and
I&#8217;ve not slept since Tuesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t rightly follow you,&#8221; said Foster, whose wits
jogged slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let them fire the door. It&#8217;s our one chance. We can
keep awake, say, for two hours longer, and the fight will
help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then Simon, who thought himself old to warfare, yielded
to a grudging admiration of this youngster who was fighting
his first battle. &#8220;Who taught ye this?&#8221; he asked, with simple
curiosity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>&#8220;The years behind,&#8221; snapped Rupert.</p>

<p>They listened to the stealthy goings and comings out of
doors. Between the house-wall and the line of fire from
Rupert&#8217;s window there was a clear five yards of sanctuary;
and along this track of safety they could hear Goldstein&#8217;s men
scrunch to and fro, carrying fuel of all kinds to the sturdy
main door that had barred their progress until now. And
once they heard a gruff command from the sergeant who led
this enterprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stir yourselves, fools!&#8221; The rough German tongue
sounded muffled from below. &#8220;We&#8217;ll catch &#8217;em asleep; and
there&#8217;s thirty thousand pounds indoors, and wine, and comfort;
stir yourselves, my lads!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert did not understand the language of these hired soldiers,
but the rough edge of a man&#8217;s voice carries meaning,
whatever tongue he speaks.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no time to waste, Simon. We must get all our
muskets down into the hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crossed the landing, told Ben Shackleton what was in
the doing, and the three of them made speed with carrying
the muskets down. The two older men borrowed something
of the master&#8217;s eagerness and fire, forgetting that they were
half dead for lack of sleep&mdash;sleep, which is more vital to a
man than food, or drink, or happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll fire the door, and come through the gap,&#8221; said
Rupert, as if he spoke of trifles. &#8220;I take this wall; you stand
close against the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I catch your drift, master,&#8221; said Simon, with a slow grip
of understanding. &#8220;We shall be i&#8217; the dark, and they&#8217;ll be
red-litten by a bonfire o&#8217; their own making. And they&#8217;ll have
one shot apiece to fire, but we&#8217;ll have six. You frame not so
varry ill, seeing how young you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>The master, by the light of a solitary candle that stood in
a sconce overhead, saw to the priming of his muskets, laid
them in an orderly row along the floor, and watched his men
while they did the like. And then he bent an ear toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
main door. Its thickness, and the settle up-ended against it,
let no sound come through, save now and then a dulled oath
or quick command. And again there was a waiting-time, one
of many that had come to Windyhough.</p>

<p>Rupert, sure that he would not be needed for a while, ran
up the stairs and found Nance still sleeping like a child at
her post, and roused her gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you hurt?&#8221; she asked, scarce awake from a dream
of onset and of fury that had pictured Rupert in the forefront
of the battle.</p>

<p>And then he told her&mdash;quickly, because this was time stolen
from his work downstairs&mdash;that she must get Lady Royd into
the kitchen, must wait there with the women-servants till they
knew how the night&#8217;s battle went. If the house were taken,
they were to escape by the kitchen door, find their way to the
disused farmstead in the hollow, and hide there till Goldstein&#8217;s
men had ridden off.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there are only three of you,&#8221; said Nance, alert once
more. &#8220;You let me keep a window for you, Rupert&mdash;are
you afraid I shall go to sleep again if I join your company
downstairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I command here,&#8221; he said briefly, &#8220;and you obey.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the thickest tumult women have odd methods of their
own. &#8220;Obey? I never liked the word. I come with you&mdash;where
the gunshots are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Rupert.</p>

<p>And, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, an open quarrel in her glance.</p>

<p>So then the master, by sheer, blundering honesty, found
the right way with her. &#8220;Nance, you&#8217;ll weaken me if you
come down. Nothing that can happen to me&mdash;nothing&mdash;can
hurt me as&mdash;as what would chance if Goldstein&#8217;s brutes got
through us.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the hurry and suspense, Nance found leisure&mdash;long almost
as eternity&mdash;to see Rupert as he was. This was his
courage, this was his love for her&mdash;a love asking nothing, except
to stand between herself and danger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I think I shall obey.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the master, greatly daring, lifted her hand, and
touched it with his lips. &#8220;God bless you, Nance!&#8221; he said,
as if he toasted royalty.</p>

<p>He went down the stair, took his place at the wall, and
stood nursing a musket in his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re long in getting their durned fire alight,&#8221; said
Ben Shackleton, with a nonchalance bred of great excitement.</p>

<p>Simon Foster&#8217;s unrest took another form of outlet. He
crossed to the master&#8217;s side of the hall, reached up and blew
the candle out. &#8220;Best take no risks,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;You
were always a bit unpractical, master, though I say it to your
face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two hours or so before, Will Underwood had led his company
of good livers and poor loyalists across the frozen snow
to the roomy stretch of water that was known as Priest&#8217;s
Tarn. It was a white and austere land they crossed&mdash;league
after league of shrouded, rolling heath that stretched to the
still, frozen skies. The moon, hard and clear-cut, seemed
only to increase the savage desolation by interpreting its
nakedness.</p>

<p>The company were not burdened by the awe and stillness
of the night. They had dined well; there was prospect of
good sport; the going underfoot was crisp and pleasant. It
was only when they reached the Tarn, and Will Underwood
looked down at the gables of Windyhough, snowy in the
moonlight a quarter of a mile below, that some keenness of
regret took hold of him. Nance was under the roof yonder;
and he loved her with a passion that had been strengthened,
cleansed of much dross, since she put shame on him; and yet
he was forbidden to go down and ask how she was faring.
Even his hardihood could not face a second time the contempt
that had given him a kerchief, because he might need
a flag of truce.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Will all in a dream, with his eyes on Windyhough,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
laughed the jolly, red-faced squire. &#8220;Well, well! We all
know Nance Demaine is a bonnie lass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Underwood turned sharply, too sick at heart to care how
openly he showed his feelings. &#8220;We&#8217;ll not discuss Miss Demaine,
sir; our record is not clean enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>The squire was ruffled by the taunt, because he, too, was
uneasy touching this stay-at-home policy that once had
seemed so prudent. &#8220;The man&#8217;s in love,&#8221; he said, with boisterous
raillery. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Lancashire packed thick with pretty
women, and he thinks there&#8217;s only one swan in the county.
Will, you must let me laugh. To be young&mdash;and sick with
love&mdash;it&#8217;s a fine, silly business. And little Nance has
frowned, has she, when we thought you the prime favourite?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want a duel,&#8221; said Underwood suddenly, &#8220;you
can have it. The moon&#8217;s light is good enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no swords.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but we have our fowling-pieces&mdash;say, at twenty paces.
The light is good enough, I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were seven in the party, and five of them at least
were not disposed to miss their duck-shooting because two of
their number chose to pick a quarrel. And, somehow, by
ridicule, persuasion, threats of interference, they staved off
the duel. And Will Underwood turned his back on Windyhough,
regained a little of his old, easy self, and settled to
the night&#8217;s business.</p>

<p>They put on the linen coats they had brought with them,
each laughing as he watched his neighbour struggle with
sleeves too narrow to go easily over their thick wearing-gear,
and took their stations round the Tarn. They stood there
silently, and waited; and they were white against white snow,
so that even the keen-eyed duck could see nothing in this
waste of silence except the glinting gun-barrels.</p>

<p>They waited for it might be half an hour, till the cold began
to nip them. The black waters of the Tarn showed in
eerie contrast to the never-ending white that hemmed its borders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
And then the wild-duck began to come, some flying
low, some swinging high against the moon and starry sky.
And one and all of the seven ghostly sportsmen forgot they
were due with Prince Charles Edward on the road of honour;
for there is a wild, absorbing glee about this moortop
sport that cancels men&#8217;s regrets and shame.</p>

<p>Will Underwood shot well to-night. He picked the highest
birds, from sheer zest in his marksmanship; and he saw the
feathers, time after time, fluff up against the moonlight,
watched his bird come down with that quick, slanting drop
which is the curve of beauty.</p>

<p>Then there was another waiting-time. It was easy to
gather their birds, for they showed plain against the snow,
and the green feathers of the drakes glanced in the moonlight
with a strange, other-worldly sheen.</p>

<p>&#8220;A night worth living for, Will,&#8221; said the red-faced squire,
as he went again to his station.</p>

<p>The duck were long in coming, and while they waited two
musket-shots rang out from the dingle that sheltered Windyhough
below. The uproar was so loud on the still air, so
unexpected, that the men forgot the need of silence, and
drew together, and asked each other sharply what it meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rupert the cavalier aiming at the moon,&#8221; snapped Underwood.
&#8220;He always did. He will wake his lady mother&#8217;s
spaniel.&#8221;</p>

<p>No other shot sounded from below, and they returned at
last to their waiting for the duck to come over. But Will
Underwood kept his eyes steadily on the house below, and
wondered, with an unrest that gained strength every moment,
if all were well with Nance. He was roused by a sharp call
from the squire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your bird, Will!&#8221;</p>

<p>Will glanced up by instinct, saw a drake winging big and
high overhead, and brought him down. Then he looked
across at Windyhough again, and saw a flicker of crimson
shoot up against the leafless tree that guarded it. The flicker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
grew to a ruddy, pulsing shaft of flame till the roof-snow
took on a rose-colour.</p>

<p>Underwood, ruffler, stay-at-home, and man of prudence,
felt thanksgiving stir about his heart. There was danger
threatening Windyhough; and Nance was there, and his single
thought was for her safety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, with a quiet gravity, &#8220;the duck
must wait. We&#8217;re needed there at Windyhough.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>THE PLEASANT FURY</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Windyhough there was an end of watching. Sleep had
been the one traitor within-doors, and Goldstein&#8217;s men, by firing
the main door, had killed their comrade in the garrison.
Rupert, fingering one of his six muskets, was tasting the
keenest happiness that had come to him as yet. Ben Shackleton,
as he watched the timbers of the doorway flame and glow,
forgot that he had a farm, a wife, and twenty head of cattle
needing him. And Simon Foster, for his part, remembered
the &#8217;15, the slow years afterwards, and knew that it was good
to be alive at last.</p>

<p>They watched the fire eat at the woodwork, watched the
shifting play of colour; and, apart from the roar of the
flames, the cracking of strained timbers, there was silence on
each side of the crumbling barricades. Then suddenly the
whole middle of the door fell inward, and in the pulsing light
outside Rupert saw a press of men.</p>

<p>And the battle at the main door here was guided with wise
generalship, as it had been at the outer gate some days ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221; said the master sharply.</p>

<p>His own musket was the first to answer the command, then
Shackleton&#8217;s, and afterwards Simon Foster&#8217;s. In the red
light, and at such close quarters, they could not miss their
aim, and three of Goldstein&#8217;s company dropped headlong into
the flaming gap, hindering those behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221; said the master again, with quick precision.</p>

<p>And then the attacking company withdrew a while, after
sending a hurried, useless volley through the hall. They had
been prepared for a fight within-doors against a garrison of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
unknown strength, but not for this welcome on the threshold.</p>

<p>The sergeant, hard-bitten and old to campaigning, was dismayed
for a moment as he looked at his lessened company.
When they came first to Windyhough this band of Goldstein&#8217;s
had numbered one-and-twenty. Now, at the end of
two days, he could count only ten; the rest were either killed
or laid aside beyond present hope of action. It was no pleasant
beginning for an assault upon the darkness that lay inside
the burning woodwork of the door.</p>

<p>Then he got himself in hand again. Whatever the unknown
odds against them, their one chance was to go forward,
now the door was down.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve tasted hell before,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;Steady, you
fools! You&#8217;re not frightened of the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang forward, and at the moment the last timbers of
the doorway fell and flamed on the threshold, lighting up the
whole width of the hall. He saw Simon Foster standing by
the wall and levelling his musket, and fired sharply and hit
him through the ribs. And after that was Bedlam, confused
and maniacal and full of oaths; but to Rupert the glamour of
his life had dawned in earnest.</p>

<p>He fired into the incoming company, and so did Ben
Shackleton; and then they retreated to the stairfoot, carrying
a musket apiece.</p>

<p>There were eight left now of Goldstein&#8217;s men, and they
rushed in with such fury that they jostled one another, hindering
their aim. Eight shots spat viciously at the garrison
of two, and Shackleton&#8217;s right arm was hit by a bullet that
glanced wide from the masonry behind him. He clubbed his
musket with the left hand and brought it down on the head
of the man nearest to him, and then he was borne down by
numbers.</p>

<p>Rupert, not for the first time in his life, was alone against
long odds. But to-night he was master of his house, master
of the clean, eager soul that had waited for this battle.
From the kitchen, where he had bidden his women-folk take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
shelter, he heard Lady Royd&#8217;s spaniel yapping furiously; and
he smiled, because old memories were stirred.</p>

<p>He went up five steps of the stairway, singled out the sergeant,
because he was the bulkiest of the seven left, and fired
point-blank at him. After that there was no leisure for any
one of them to reload; it was simply Rupert on the narrow
stairway, swinging his musket lightly, against six maddened
troopers who could only come up one by one.</p>

<p>It was Nance who intervened disastrously. She did not
know&mdash;how could she&mdash;that the master, at the end of a dismaying,
harassed vigil, was stronger than the six who met
him. They were dulled to the glory of assault, but he was
gathering up the dreams of the long, unproven years, was
fighting his first battle, was armoured by a faith more keen
and vivid than this world&#8217;s weaknesses could touch.</p>

<p>Nance, sick to know how it was faring with the master,
weary of the yapping spaniel and the old housekeeper&#8217;s complaint
that she wished to die decently in her bed, out of eye-shot
of rude men&mdash;Nance crept up the back stair, and took a
musket from the ledge of the north window she had guarded.
Then she went down again, crossed the passage that led to
the main hall, halted a moment as she saw Rupert on the stair,
the six men below&mdash;all lit by the unearthly, crimson flare of
burning woodwork&mdash;and lifted her musket with trim precision.</p>

<p>She had lessened the odds by one; but Rupert, glancing
down to see who had fired so unexpectedly, saw Nance standing
at the rear of this battle which was his. And his weakness
took him unawares. He had been dominant and gay,
because he carried his life lightly; but now there was Nance&#8217;s
honour. One of the five left came up at him, and Rupert&#8217;s
aim was true with the butt-end of his musket; but he was
not fighting now with a single purpose, and he knew it. And
sleep, kept at bay through every minute of every hour that
had struck since Goldstein&#8217;s men came first, began to claim its
toll.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>He could not hold the stair, sleep whispered at his ear.
And he rallied bravely, afraid for the first time because of
Nance. If he should fail to keep the stair? A sharp, unreasoning
anger seized him. Why was she here? Women
were good to send men into battle, to bind their wounds up
afterwards, but in the hot, keen thick of it they had no place.
Do as he would, his glance kept seeking the little figure that
stood on the edge of the fire-glow, and the men pressing up
were quick to see the change in him.</p>

<p>With a last, hard effort he shut down all thought of Nance.
The troopers he had stunned lay sprawling down the stair,
hindering the men behind. For a moment there was respite,
and in that moment sleep thickened round the master&#8217;s eyelids.
The confidence, the sense of treading air, borrowed at
usury from his strength, were fast deserting him. He had
victory full in sight on this narrow stair, and, like his Prince,
he felt it slip past him out of reach, for no cause that seemed
logical.</p>

<p>Nance did not guess the share she had had in this. She
saw only that Rupert stooped suddenly, as if in mortal sickness,
then squared his shoulders&mdash;saw that one of the men at
the stairfoot was reloading his musket with deft haste, and
shut her eyes. For she, too, was weak from lack of sleep.</p>

<p>Will Underwood, meanwhile, was running down the moor,
the red-faced squire and the other sporting recusants behind
him. There was no doubt now that Windyhough was in urgent
peril. They could see the flaming doorway, could smell
the scudding reek of smoke that came up-wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re up to the neck in love,&#8221; protested the squire, trying
to keep pace with Will. &#8220;There&#8217;s naught else gives such
wind to a man&#8217;s feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sharp noise of musketry answered him from below, and
Will ran ever a little faster. The squire&#8217;s gibe did not trouble
him. The whole past life of him&mdash;the squalor of his
youth, the sterile abnegation of the Sabbaths spent at Rigstones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Chapel, the gradual change to ease and popularity
among big-hearted gentry&mdash;passed by him like a fast-moving
company of ghosts. And then another phantom stole, with
faltering steps and shrouded head, across this vision he was
borrowing from another world. He saw his cowardice, lean,
shrivelled, stooping&mdash;the cowardice that had been born of
ease and frank self-seeking. He had pledged faith that he
would follow the Stuart when need asked; and he had broken
troth, because he yearned to keep his house and lands, because
he had planned to give a ball at Christmas that should
set all Lancashire talking of its pomp.</p>

<p>God was very kind to-night to Wild Will. The run was
short and swift to Windyhough, as time is reckoned; but during
the scamper over broken ground he found that leisure of
the soul which is cradled in eternity. He won free of his
past. He knew only that the squire had spoken a true word
in jest.</p>

<p>He was deep in love. All the ache and trouble of his need
for Nance were wiped clean away. She was in danger, and
he was running to her aid; and he understood, with a clean
and happy sense of well-being, the way of his Catholic friends
when they loved a woman. Until now it had been a riddle to
him, the quality of this regard. He had seen them love as
full-blooded men do&mdash;with storm and jealousy and passionate
unrest, but always with a subtle reserve, a princely deference,
shining dimly through it all. And to-night, his vision
singularly clear, he knew that their faith was more than lip
speech, knew that the Madonna had come once, and once for
all, to show the path of chivalry.</p>

<p>If Rupert had found happiness during this siege that had
tested his manhood, so, too, had Will Underwood. With a
single purpose, with desire only to serve Nance, asking no
thanks or recompense, he raced over the last strip of broken
ground and through the courtyard gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be gad! they&#8217;ve been busy here!&#8221; growled the red-faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
squire, seeing the bodies lying black against the snow and
hearing the wounded crying in their anguish. But Will did
not see the littered yard, the white, keen moonlight that
spared no ugly detail. His eyes were fixed on the burning
threshold&mdash;Nance was behind it, and she needed him.</p>

<p>The fallen doorway, the blazing remnants of the settle, had
set fire by now to the woodwork of the hall. Will ran
through the heat and smoke of it, saw Rupert swaying dizzily
half up the stair, and below him four Hessian troopers, one of
whom was lifting a musket to his shoulder. He had his
fowling-piece in hand, half-cocked by instinct when he left
the duck-shooting for this scamper down the moor. He
cocked it, and at the moment the trooper who was taking aim
at Rupert turned sharply, hearing the din of feet behind, saw
a press of men, white from head to foot, pouring through the
doorway, and fired heedlessly at Underwood. And Will&#8217;s
fowling-piece barked at the same moment; at six paces the
charge of shot was compact and solid as a bullet, but the
wound it made was larger, and not clean at all.</p>

<p>The three troopers left faced round on the incoming company.
They saw seven men, white in the linen coats they had
not found thought or leisure to throw off, and sudden panic
seized them. Through the stark waiting-time of their siege,
with the moors and the sobbing winds to foster superstition,
they had learned belief in ghosts, and thought they saw them
now. They ran blindly for the doorway. Rupert leaped
from the stair, and they were taken front and rear.</p>

<p>When all was done, Rupert steadied himself, stood straight
and soldierly, scanned the faces of his rescuers, and knew
them all for friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;My thanks, gentlemen,&#8221; he said, with tired courtesy.
&#8220;You came in a good hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned a hand on the Red Squire&#8217;s shoulder, wiped a
trickle of blood from some chance wound that had touched
his forehead, glanced round at them with dim, unseeing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I kept the house? Have I finished?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>&#8220;The house is in our keeping now. You&#8217;ve done well, my
lad,&#8221; said the red-faced squire, with gruff tenderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll get to sleep, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he would have fallen, but the squire held him up and,
putting two rough arms about him, carried him upstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;A well-plucked one,&#8221; he said, returning quickly. &#8220;And
now, gentlemen, the house will be on fire, by your leave, if
we don&#8217;t turn our hands to the pump.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance, watching from the shadows, was bewildered by the
speed and fury of it all&mdash;bewildered more by the business-like,
quiet way in which these linen-coated gentry went in and
out of hall, carrying buckets and quenching the last smouldering
flames with water from the stable yard. This was
war&mdash;war, with its horror, its gallantry, its comedy; but it
was not the warfare she had pictured when she sang heroic
ballads at the spinet.</p>

<p>And then the night&#8217;s uproar and its madness passed by her.
She thought only of the master who had all but died just now
to save the house&mdash;to save her honour. She could not face
the busy hall, the man sprawling on the stair, head downward,
where Rupert&#8217;s blow had left him. Instead, she went
back along the corridor and up by the servants&#8217; stairway, and
found Rupert lying in a dead sleep in his own chamber, a
lighted candle at his elbow, just as the red-faced squire had
left him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, knowing he could not hear, &#8220;my
dear&#8221;&mdash;her voice broke in a deep, quiet laugh that had no
meaning to her as yet&mdash;&#8220;they said you were the scholar.
And I think they lied.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her head by and by, hearing the squire&#8217;s voice
below in the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Will Underwood?&#8221; he was asking noisily.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got the fire under, and we can see each other&#8217;s faces
now we&#8217;ve lit the candles. Where, by the Mass, is Underwood?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance shivered. Through her weariness, through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
panic of this sharp attack, she recalled the shame of her first
love, recalled her meeting with Will Underwood on the high
moors, when he had talked of loyalty as a thing of barter.</p>

<p>She stooped to touch Rupert as he slept. Here was a man,
spent and weak; but here, proved through and through, was
a cleanly gentleman who, against odds, had kept his obligations.
Old affection stirred in her, and new pride in his conduct
of the siege.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Underwood?&#8221; came the squire&#8217;s voice again.
&#8220;Is this some prank of his, to hide away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With Nance Demaine, sir,&#8221; answered some pert youngster
of the company. &#8220;Where else should he be? He was
never one to waste time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve guessed the riddle, youngster.&#8221; The squire&#8217;s
laugh was boisterous. &#8220;It&#8217;s odd to think of Underwood
lovesick as a lad in his teens&mdash;especially just now, with all
this litter in the hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside the doorway Will Underwood was lying in the
moonlight. He had been hit in the groin by Goldstein&#8217;s
trooper, just as he answered with a charge of shot at six
paces; and because the hills had bred him, he needed to get
out into the open, taking his sickness with him.</p>

<p>He lay in the snow and looked up at the sky. He had
never seen a whiter moon, a clearer light, at time of midwinter.
Land and sky were glittering with frost, and overhead
he saw the seven starry lamps of Charlie&#8217;s Wain. He
was in bitter anguish, and knew that his hurt was mortal; he
had no regret for that, because he knew, too, that Windyhough
and Nance were saved. His bitterness was of the soul.
Strain as he would, he could not shut out the picture&mdash;clear
as the frosty sky above him&mdash;of Nance&#8217;s face when she met
him on the moor&mdash;years ago, it seemed&mdash;and he thought he
was his own ghost, come to warn her of his death.</p>

<p>He lived through that scene again in detail, heard Nance&#8217;s
voice sweep all his prudent self-esteem aside. And her scorn
bit deeper now, because he knew at last the strength of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
fine regard for her. Passion was gone. Prudence was gone,
because men near to death remember that they came naked
into the world. He had lost the trickeries that had earned
him the name of Wild Will, and was glad to let them go.
He was aware only that he lay between here and hereafter,
in pain of body and soul, and that he might take this last
fence gladly, as on a hunting-morn, if he could wipe away the
remembrance of one day gone by.</p>

<p>Many things grew clear to him as he lay and watched the
moon. The wrath and pitiless hell-fire of Rigstones Chapel
yielded to a wider outlook on the forgiveness of a Being
greater than himself in charity. He found it easy to forgive
his enemies, to forget his jealousy of Rupert, whom he had
saved just now. But, warring against the peace he sought,
and keeping the life quick in his tortured body, was remembrance
of that day on the high moors. His work, good or ill,
was done, and he longed to die, and could not.</p>

<p>Into the littered hall at Windyhough, while the squire paced
up and down asking noisily for Will Underwood, old Nat the
shepherd sauntered, pipe in hand. He was old, and a
dreamer, and the gunshots and the fury had not disturbed
him greatly.</p>

<p>Nat glanced round at the fallen men and the standing, at
the doorway through whose blackened lintels the keen moonlight
stole to drown the candle-flames. And he laughed, a
gentle, pitying laugh. &#8220;It&#8217;s naught so much to brag about,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;There were bonnier doings i&#8217; the &#8217;15 Rising. Men
were men i&#8217; those days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance wearied of it all as she stood by the master&#8217;s bed
and listened to the talk downstairs. The house seemed full
of men, and insolent coupling of her name with Will Underwood&#8217;s,
and the sickly, pungent smell of blood and smoke.
She was tired of gallantry and war, tired of her own weariness;
and she went down the stair, stepping lightly over Rupert&#8217;s
enemy, and came among them into hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your servant, Miss Nance,&#8221; said the red-faced squire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
not guessing what a figure of comedy he cut, bowing under
the folds of a white linen coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, gentlemen,&#8221; said Nance unsteadily. &#8220;From
my heart I thank you. You&mdash;you have done us service.
And now, by your leave, I need to get out of doors. I&mdash;I
have been in prison here.&#8221;</p>

<p>They made a lane of honour for her. They had been laggards
in the Prince&#8217;s service; they were recusants, come at
the last hour to prove themselves; but they felt, seeing Nance
step down between them, her face stained with weariness and
long vigil, that a royal lady had come into their midst.</p>

<p>Nance went through the charred doorway, and halted a
moment as the pleasant frost-wind met her. The moonlight
and the clean face of the sky gave her a sense of ease and
liberty, after the cramped days indoors. The siege&#8217;s uproar,
its stealthy quiet, were lost in this big silence of the frosty
spaces overhead.</p>

<p>From the silence, from the snowy courtyard at her feet, a
groan brought her back sharply to realities. She looked
down, and saw Will Underwood lying face upwards to the
stars. He, too, was linen-sheeted, as the squire had been;
but there was no touch of comedy in his apparel. It seemed
to Nance that he was shrouded for his bier.</p>

<p>They looked into each other&#8217;s eyes for a while, and some
kindness in the girl&#8217;s glance, some regret to see him lying
helpless with the fire of torment in his eyes, fired his courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; she said gently. &#8220;You came to save the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Nance; I came to save you. That was my only
thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are asking for you indoors. I do not understand&mdash;you
are wounded&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In your service&mdash;yes. They were right, after all&mdash;they
always said I&#8217;d more luck than I deserved.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was free now of the bewilderment of this night attack,
the sharp battle in the hall, quick and confused in the
doing. The moonlight showed her the face of a man in obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
pain, a man fighting for every word that crossed his
lips; and yet he was smiling, and the soul of him was gay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring help,&#8221; she said, turning toward the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; you&#8217;ve brought help. Nance, I&#8217;ll not keep you long.
There was a day&mdash;a day when we met up the moor, and I
was your liar, Nance&mdash;from heel to crown I was your liar&mdash;and
God knows the shame you put on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance, scarce heeding what she did, took a kerchief,
stained with gunpowder, from the pocket of the riding-coat
she had worn, day in, day out, since the siege began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I keep my promise, Will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even yet, though Nance was kneeling in the snow beside
him and he heard the pity in her voice, Will could not free
himself from some remembrance of that bygone meeting.
&#8220;As a flag of truce?&#8221; he asked sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a badge of honour. You are free to wear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He reached out for her hand, and put it to his lips with the
reverence learned since he came down from duck-shooting to
find a mortal hurt. &#8220;As God sees me,&#8221; he said, a pleasant
note of triumph in his voice&mdash;&#8220;as God sees me, I die happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he turned on his side. And the pert youngster
who had coupled Nance&#8217;s name with Will&#8217;s, coming out in
search of the missing leader, saw the girl kneeling in the
snow and heard her sobs. And he crept back into the hall,
ashamed in some queer way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, lad, have you seen a ghost out yonder?&#8221; asked the
red-faced squire.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; the boy answered gravely. &#8220;It is as I said&mdash;Will
is with Nance Demaine, and&mdash;and I think we&#8217;d better
leave them to it.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>THE RIDING OUT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir Jasper</span>, out at Ben Shackleton&#8217;s farm, had been no easy
guest to entertain since he sought refuge there from the pursuit
of Goldstein&#8217;s men. He slept for twelve hours, after
they had laid him on the lang-settle and stopped the bleeding
from his wound; and then, for an hour, he had lain between
sleep and waking; and, after that, he was keen to be up and
doing.</p>

<p>Shackleton&#8217;s wife, dismayed because her goodman had not
returned long since from carrying his message to Windyhough,
was sharp of tongue, and lacking in deference a little,
as the way of the sturdy farm-folk is when they are troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you wish, Sir Jasper,&#8221; she said tartly. &#8220;Just get up
and stand on your two feet, and see how it feels, like.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got stubbornly to his feet, and moved a pace or two
across the floor; and then he grew weak and dizzy, and was
glad to find his way again to the lang-settle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, so!&#8221; said Shackleton&#8217;s wife. &#8220;It&#8217;s good for men-folk
to learn, just time and time, how they can go weak as a
little babby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife needs me yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, and I need my goodman here. Exchange is no robbery,
Sir Jasper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is in danger,&#8221; he snapped, with a sick man&#8217;s petulance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so&#8217;s my man, I reckon&mdash;they&#8217;ve kept him yonder, or
he&#8217;d have been home lang-syne.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then weariness conquered Sir Jasper; and he slept again
till that day passed, and the next night, and half through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
morning. It was his respite from remembrance of the retreat
from Derby, from the wound that kept him out of action.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do nicely now,&#8221; said Shackleton&#8217;s wife, glancing
round from ironing a shirt of her husband&#8217;s. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got
the look of your old self about you, Sir Jasper.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wound itself was of less account than the bleeding that
had followed it; and by nightfall he was waiting impatiently
until the shepherd saddled his mare and brought her to the
door.</p>

<p>The farm-wife looked him up and down, with the frank
glance that had only friendliness and extreme solicitude behind
it. &#8220;Eh, but you look sick and wambly,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Can you sit a horse, Sir Jasper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am hale and well,&#8221; he answered&mdash;fretfully, because he
felt his weakness and because he was fearing for his wife.</p>

<p>He got to saddle, and the mare and he went slushing up
and down the mile of bridle-track that separated them from
home. He was no longer conscious of pain or weakness; his
heart was on fire to see his wife again, to know her safe. At
the turn of the hill, just beyond the gallows-tree that stood
naked against the sky, he saw Windyhough lying below him,
the moonlight keen on snowy chimney-stacks and gables.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; he said, seeing how peaceful the old house
lay.</p>

<p>A little later he came to the splintered gateway, and his
heart misgave him. The mare fidgeted and would not go
forward; and, looking down, he saw a dead man lying in the
moonlight&mdash;the trooper at whom Rupert had fired his maiden
battle-shot.</p>

<p>He got from saddle, left the mare to her own devices, and
ran across the courtyard. Here, too, were bodies lying in
the snow. The main door was gone, save for a charred
framework through which the moon showed him a disordered
hall.</p>

<p>Without thought of his own safety here, with a single, savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
purpose to find his wife&mdash;dead or worse&mdash;he crossed the
hall; and at the stairway foot he met the red-faced squire,
coming down with a brisk tread surprising in a man of his
bulk and goutiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;By gad! we&#8217;re too busy with flesh and blood to care for
ghosts,&#8221; said the squire, halting suddenly. His laugh was
boisterous, but it covered a superstition lively and afraid.</p>

<p>&#8220;A truce to nonsense,&#8221; snapped Sir Jasper. &#8220;Where is
Lady Royd?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Asleep&mdash;and her toy spaniel, too.&#8221; The squire had come
down and touched Sir Jasper to make sure that he was of
this world. &#8220;I should poison that dog if it were mine, Royd.
It yapped at every wounded man we carried in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife is asleep&mdash;and safe?&#8221; asked the other, as if he
feared the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all safe&mdash;except poor Will Underwood; and all
busy, thanks to that game pup of yours. For a scholar, he
shaped well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rupert kept the house?&#8221; Through all his trouble and unrest
Sir Jasper tried to grasp the meaning of the charred
doorway, the groans of wounded men above. &#8220;It did not
seem so when I came indoors.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then the Squire told him, all in clipped, hurried speech,
the way of it. And Sir Jasper forgot his wife, forgot his
wound, and all the misery that had dogged his steps since
Derby. He had an heir at last. Rupert, the well-beloved,
had proved himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; he asked huskily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Asleep, too, by your leave. No, we&#8217;ll not wake him.
He&#8217;s had three days of gunpowder and wakefulness, Royd.
Let him sleep the clock round.&#8221;</p>

<p>The squire, seeing how weak Sir Jasper was, took him by
the arm into the dining-chamber, filled him a measure of
brandy, and pushed him gently into a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came late to the wedding, Royd,&#8221; he said dryly, &#8220;but
I&#8217;m in command here, till you find your strength.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>Sir Jasper, for the first time since Derby, was content.
His wife was safe, and his heir was a man at last. And the
red-faced squire, whom he had always liked, was no recusant,
after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;You talked of carrying wounded men in?&#8221; he asked by
and by. &#8220;I can hear them crying out for thirst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where they have us, Royd, these flea-bitten men
of George&#8217;s,&#8221; said the squire, with another boisterous laugh.
&#8220;They were crying like stuck pigs&mdash;out in the cold&mdash;and we
<i>had</i> to take them in. Windyhough is a hospital, I tell you,
owing to the queer Catholic training that weakens us.
They&#8217;d not have done as much for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is their loss&mdash;and, as for training, I think Rupert
has proved it fairly right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes. But I hate wounds, Royd, and all the sickroom
messiness. It&#8217;s an ill business, tending men you&#8217;d
rather see lying snugly in their graves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper laughed, not boisterously at all, but with the
tranquil gaiety that comes of sadness. &#8220;There was a worse
business, friend, at Derby. I went through it; and, I tell
you, nothing matters very much&mdash;nothing will ever matter
again, unless the Prince finds his battle up in Scotland.&#8221;</p>

<p>And by and by they fell to talking of ways and means.
Sir Jasper was pledged to rejoin the Prince, and would not
break his word. Neither would he leave his son at Windyhough
a second time, among the women and old men. And
yet&mdash;there was his wife, who needed him.</p>

<p>The red-faced squire, blunt and full of cheery common
sense, resolved his difficulties. &#8220;Cannot you trust us, Royd?
There&#8217;ll be six men of us&mdash;seven, counting Simon Foster,
who is getting better of his hurt&mdash;and only wounded prisoners
to guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if another company of roving blackguards rides
this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not likely. By your own showing, the hunt goes wide
of this. Besides, we shall get a new doorway up. Rupert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
held the house with two to help him&mdash;seven of us could do
the like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper began to pace restlessly up and down. &#8220;You
forget,&#8221; he said sharply, &#8220;it will be my wife you&#8217;re guarding&mdash;my
wife&mdash;and she means so much to me, old friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We know, we know. D&#8217;ye think we&#8217;d let hurt come to
her? Listen, Royd. When these jackanapes who groan in
German are fit to look after themselves, we&#8217;ll leave them to
it, and take all your women with us to my house at Ravenscliff.
And word shall go round that Lady Royd&mdash;the toast
of the county to this day&mdash;needs gentlemen about her. She&#8217;ll
not lack friends, I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The squire&#8217;s glance fell as it met Sir Jasper&#8217;s. His conscience
was uneasy still, and he fancied a rebuke that was
far from Royd&#8217;s thoughts. So had the Prince been the
county&#8217;s toast&mdash;until the Prince asked instant service.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can trust you,&#8221; said Sir Jasper, with sudden decision.
&#8220;Guard her&mdash;as God sees us, she is&mdash;is very dear to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, after a restless silence, Sir Jasper&#8217;s doubts, bred of
bodily weakness, ran into a new channel.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s yourself to think of in all this&mdash;your own wife,
and your house. The Hanover men will not be gentle if we
lose the battle up in Scotland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Royd,&#8221; said the red-faced squire, not fearing now to meet
his glance, &#8220;we&#8217;ve come badly out of this, we fools who
stayed at home. There&#8217;s been no flavour in our wine; we&#8217;ve
been poor fox-hunters, not caring whether we were in at the
death or no&mdash;you&#8217;ll not grudge us our one chance to play the
man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jasper understood at last that recusants can have their
evil moments, can find worse cheer than he had met at Derby.</p>

<p>&#8220;I warn you, Ned, there&#8217;s small chance of our winning
now. For old friendship&#8217;s sake, I&#8217;ll not let you go blindly
into this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the ballad Nance Demaine sings so nattily?
<i>Life&#8217;s losing and land&#8217;s losing, and what were they to gi&#8217;e?</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Oh, it&#8217;s all true, Royd. We have our chance at last&mdash;and,
gad! we mean to take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It bites deep, Ned,&#8221; said the other, with grave concern.
&#8220;It bites deep, this wife losing and land losing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not as deep as shame,&#8221; snapped the red-faced squire.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a free man of my hands again. And now, by the look
of you, you&#8217;d best get to bed. Honest man to honest man,
Royd, you&#8217;re dead-beat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;if the house is safe,&#8221; said Sir Jasper, with unalterable
simplicity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, trust me, Royd! I&#8217;m in command here&mdash;and, I tell
you, all is safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went upstairs, and into his wife&#8217;s room. There was a
candle burning on the table at her elbow, and he forgot his
own need of sleep in watching hers. The strain of the past
days was gone. She lay like a child at peace with God and
man, and the peevish, day-time wrinkles were smoothed away;
and she was dreaming, had her husband known it, of the
days when she had come, as a bride, to Windyhough.</p>

<p>A gusty tenderness, a reverence beyond belief, came to Sir
Jasper. He forgot all hardships Derby way. The simple
heart of him was content with the day&#8217;s journey, so long as it
brought him this&mdash;his wife secure, with happiness asleep
about her face.</p>

<p>He stooped to touch her, and the spaniel sleeping at her
side stood up and barked at him, rousing the mistress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet!&#8221; she said sleepily. &#8220;I was dreaming&mdash;that
my lord came home again, forgiving all my foolishness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The spaniel only barked the more. And Sir Jasper, who
was by way of being rough just now with all intruders, big
or little, pitched him out on to the landing.</p>

<p>His wife was awake now, and she looked at him with wide
eyes of misery. &#8220;You have kept tryst, my dear. You promised&mdash;when
you rode out&mdash;that, if you died, you would come
to tell me of it. And I&mdash;God help me!&mdash;was dreaming that
we were young again together.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>&#8220;We&#8217;re very young again together, Agnes,&#8221; said Sir Jasper,
with a quiet laugh. &#8220;Do I look so ghostly that you all
mistake me for a wraith?&#8221;</p>

<p>She touched him, as the squire had done&mdash;gently at first,
and then with gaining confidence. &#8220;You look&mdash;as I have
never seen you, husband; you are as grey of face as Rupert,
when his work was done and they carried him upstairs. Your
wound&mdash;Jasper, it is not mortal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is healing fast. There, wife, you are only half awake,
and I&#8217;m dishevelled. I had no time to put myself in order.
I was too eager just&mdash;just to see my wife again.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Lady Royd was wide awake now. Not only the husband,
but the lover, had returned. &#8220;I shall have to take
care of you, Jasper,&#8221; she said, with the woman&#8217;s need to be
protective when she is happy. &#8220;You&#8217;ll need nursing,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need sleep,&#8221; growled Sir Jasper&mdash;&#8220;just a few hours&#8217;
sleep, Agnes, and&mdash;and forgetfulness of Derby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, sleep! That has been our need, too. We&mdash;we none
of us went out with you, Jasper&mdash;but we kept the house.
And we learned what sleep means&mdash;more than food or drink,
more than any gift that we can ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is in the hurried, perilous moments that men come to
understanding. Sir Jasper, by the little said and the much
left unsaid, knew that his wife, according to her strength,
had taken a brave part in this enterprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk of what old campaigners know,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And there was a little, pleasant silence; and after that
Lady Royd looked into her husband&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are home again&mdash;to stay until your wound is
healed?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my dear. I take the road to-morrow. The Prince
needs me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her face to the wall. And temptation played
like a windy night about Sir Jasper, taking him at the ebb
of his strength, as all cowards do. He was more weak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
body than she guessed; he had given really of himself, and
surely he had earned a little ease, a sitting by the hearth
while he told his wife, this once again, what was in his heart
for her.</p>

<p>And his wife turned suddenly. Her eyes were radiant
with the faith that siege had taught her&mdash;siege, and the reek
of gunpowder, and the way men carried themselves in the
face of the bright comrade, danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, Jasper&mdash;and good luck to your riding,&#8221; she said
quietly.</p>

<p>At two of the next afternoon Sir Jasper and Rupert got
to saddle; and the father, knowing the way of his son&#8217;s
heart, rode on ahead down the long, sloping bridle-track,
leaving him to say good-bye to Nance Demaine.</p>

<p>Nance had been used to courage, as she was used to wind
on the hills; but all her world was slipping from her now.
She had given her kerchief to Will Underwood, from pity
for a love that was dead and hidden out of sight; she had
gone through stress and turmoil; and at the end of all Rupert,
her one friend here, was riding out with his eyes on the hills,
though she stood at his stirrup and sought his glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;God speed, Rupert!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He stooped to kiss her hand, but his thoughts were far
away. &#8220;It seemed all past praying for, Nance&mdash;and it has
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has come?&#8221; she asked&mdash;peevishly, because she
was tired and very lonely. &#8220;Fire, and sleeplessness, and the
cries of wounded men&mdash;what else has come to Windyhough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Stuart songs,&#8221; he answered gravely. &#8220;Stuart deeds
are coming my way, Nance, at long last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&mdash;are glad to go, Rupert?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked down at her and for a moment he forgot the
road ahead. He saw only Nance&mdash;Nance, whom he had loved
from boyhood&mdash;Nance, with the wholesome, bonnie face that
discerning men, who could see the soul behind it, named beautiful.
All his keen young love for her was needing outlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
on the sudden. She was so near, so friendly; and about her
was a clear, eager starshine, such as lovers see.</p>

<p>The siege, and killing of a man here and there, stepped in
and conquered this old weakness that was hindering him.
&#8220;Nance, my dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall come back&mdash;when I&#8217;m
your proven man.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was so he went quietly out into the sunlight that had
struggled free awhile of the grey, wintry clouds. And again
Nance was chilled, as she had been when the Loyal Meet rode
out&mdash;years ago, it seemed&mdash;without sound of drum or any
show of pageantry. She had not learned even yet that men
with a single purpose go about their business quietly, not heeding
bugle-calls of this world&#8217;s sounding.</p>

<p>She watched him go, old pity and old liking stirred. And
she longed to call him back, but pride forbade her.</p>

<p>Simon Foster came grumbling through the charred courtyard
gate. He had stood at the hilltop, watching the old
master and the young go out along the track he was too infirm
to follow; and there was a deep, abiding bitterness in
his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;They shouldn&#8217;t have gi&#8217;en me a taste o&#8217; fight, Miss
Nance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I call it fair shameful just to whet a
body&#8217;s appetite, and then give him naught solid to follow.
Oh, I tell ye, it&#8217;s ill work staying at home, tied up wi&#8217; rheumatiz.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance was glad of the respite from her own muddled
thoughts, from the sense of loss that Rupert had left her as
a parting gift. &#8220;It is time you settled down,&#8221; she said, with
a touch of the humour that was never far from her. &#8220;And
you have Martha to make up for all you&#8217;re losing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, true,&#8221; grumbled Simon, his eyes far away; &#8220;but
Martha could have bided till I&#8217;d had my fill, like. She&#8217;s patient&mdash;it&#8217;s
in the build of her&mdash;but, I never was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Patience?&#8221; said Nance. &#8220;It is in no woman&#8217;s build,
Simon. We have to learn it, while our men are enjoying the
free weather.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>Rupert had overtaken his father on the winding, downhill
track, and they rode in silence together for a mile or so, each
thinking of the other and of the work ahead. It was a
pleasant, deep communion for them both; and the son remembered,
for the last time, how Sir Jasper had lied to him
in giving him the house of Windyhough to keep. From the
soldiery learnt there, from the peril waiting for them ahead,
Rupert had won the priceless gift, forgiveness&mdash;a herb troublesome
and hard to find.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re silent, lad,&#8221; said Sir Jasper, as they came to the
stretch of level track that took them right-handed into the
Langton road.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking&mdash;that dreams come true, sir, as I said to
Nance just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clouds were hurrying up against the sun&mdash;yellow, evil
clouds, packed thick with snow&mdash;and a bitter wind was rising.
The going underfoot was vile. Their errand was to
join an army in retreat, with likelihood that they would dine
and breakfast on disaster. And yet&mdash;because God made them
so&mdash;they found tranquillity. Sir Jasper had dreamed of this,
since his first gladness that he had an heir, his first sorrow
when he admitted to himself, grudgingly, that the boy was not
as strong as he had wished. And Rupert, while his shoulders
found their scholarly droop in reading old books at Windyhough,
had shared the same dream&mdash;that one day, by a miracle,
he might ride out with his father on the Stuart&#8217;s business.</p>

<p>And they were here together. And nothing mattered,
somehow, as the way of men is when their souls have taken
the open, friendly road.</p>

<p>They rode hard in pursuit of the Prince&#8217;s army, nursing
their horses&#8217; strength as far as eagerness would let them;
and, at long last, they overtook their friends on the windy
summit of Shap Fell, where the Stuart army was bivouacked
for the night.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper asked audience of the Prince, and found him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
sitting in his tent, eating a stew of sheep&#8217;s kidneys&mdash;the one
luxury royalty could command at the moment. And the
Prince rose, forgetting his quality, in frank welcome of this
man who had shared the evil Derby days with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you dead, sir; and I&#8217;m very glad to see you&mdash;alive,
but thinner than you were.&#8221;</p>

<p>No detail ever escaped the Prince&#8217;s eye, when he was
concerned about the welfare of his friends; and the solicitude,
the affection of this greeting atoned for many hardships.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wounded, your Highness, or should have been with
you long since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So much I knew. No other hindrance would have kept
you,&#8221; said the Prince, with flattering trust.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bring a volunteer with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be staunch indeed! A volunteer to join us in
these days of havoc? Has he been jilted by one of your
Lancashire witches, that he&#8217;s eager to trudge through this
evil weather?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. He has just won through a siege on your behalf&mdash;the
siege of my own house&mdash;and could not rest till he had seen
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince had been in a black mood of despair not long
ago. He was alone in his tent, with none to need him for
the moment, none to know if he were sick at heart. Like
all men, great or small, he was at once the victim and the captain
of the temperament given him at birth; and none but
the Stuarts knew how dearly they purchased&mdash;through lonely
hours of misery, self-doubt, denial of all hope&mdash;the charm,
the gay, unyielding courage that touched the dullest wayfarers
with some fine hint of betterment.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper&#8217;s coming had cleared the Prince&#8217;s outlook.
In the man&#8217;s simplicity, in the obvious love he held
for this unknown volunteer, the Stuart read a request unspoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Present him,&#8221; he said, with the smile that had tempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
men and women alike to follow him for love. &#8220;He&#8217;ll forgive
me if I finish this stew of kidneys? For I own I&#8217;m
devilish hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the toilsome ride from Windyhough to Shap,
Rupert had talked of the Prince, and only of the Prince; and
Sir Jasper went now to find his heir, proud&mdash;as simple men
are&mdash;of the transparent diplomacy that had secured Rupert
his heart&#8217;s desire so promptly. He did not find him at once
among the busy camp; and when they were admitted to the
royal tent, his Highness had finished his meal, and was smoking
the disreputable pipe that had been his friend throughout
this weary, meaningless retreat.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son, your Highness,&#8221; said Sir Jasper.</p>

<p>Rupert, coming out of the stark night outside, blinked as
he met the flickering light of the rush-candles within the
tent. Then his eyes cleared, and some trouble took him by
the throat. He was young, and in the Presence; and his
dreams had been greatly daring, sweeping up to the stars of
Stuart loyalty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I commend you, sir,&#8221; said the Prince, looking the lad
through and through, as his way was, to learn what shape he
had. &#8220;There are apt to be volunteers when a cause is gaining,
but few when it&#8217;s escaping to the hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heart of a man, kept bridled for five-and-twenty years,
knows no reticence when it meets at last the comrade of its
long desire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness,&#8221; said Rupert, with a simplicity larger
than his father&#8217;s, because less way-worn, &#8220;I begin to live. I
asked to serve you, and&mdash;and the prayer is granted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You join us in retreat?&#8221; said the Prince, touched by the
pity of this hero-worship.</p>

<p>&#8220;I join you either way. I&#8217;ve found&mdash;why, happiness, I
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince was a few months younger than himself; but
he touched him now on the shoulder, as a father might.
&#8220;Good luck to your honour lad!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Clean the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
world&#8217;s mud off from it whenever you find leisure, as you
polish a sword-blade. That&#8217;s the soldier&#8217;s gospel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day they were on the march again. The
weather was not gentle on the top of Shap Fell, and the red
sun, rising into a clear and frosty sky, showed them a lonely
and a naked land&mdash;hills reaching out to farther hills, desolate,
snow-white, and dumb. Not a bird called. The Highlanders,
with their steady, swinging strides, the horsemen moving
at a sober pace, were ringed about with silence. Before
nightfall, however, they reached Clifton village, and here at
last they found diversion from the day&#8217;s austerity.</p>

<p>The Prince, with the greater part of his cavalry, had pushed
forward to Penrith; but Lord Elcho, who, with Sir Jasper&#8217;s
horsemen, had charge of the rear, gave a sharp sigh of
thanksgiving when a messenger brought news that the Duke
of Cumberland, with his own regiment and Kingston&#8217;s light
horse, were close at his heels after ten hours&#8217; hard pursuit.
Elcho was glad even of the long odds against him, knowing
that his Highlanders were wearying for battle, and made his
dispositions with a cheery sense that the Duke had done them
a good turn in overtaking them.</p>

<p>Taking full advantage of the cover afforded by the country,
Elcho placed his men behind the hedges and stone walls,
and as the first of the dusk came down the Duke&#8217;s soldiery
delivered their attack. It was a sharp, bewildering skirmish,
ended speedily by nightfall; but to Rupert, fighting in the
open after the stifled days at Windyhough, it was easy to show
a gallantry that roused the applause of men grown old and
hard to combat. And ever he thought less of Nance, and
more of this new comrade, danger, whose face was bright,
alluring.</p>

<p>They left the Duke with his dead; and, because they were
hopelessly outnumbered if the daylight found them still in
possession of Clifton, they went through the black night to
Penrith, bringing news to the Prince of their little victory.
And after that it was forward to Carlisle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>THE FORLORN HOPE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> can be bitter cold in Carlisle, when the wind raves down
from the Border country and the rain will not be quiet; but
never had the grey town shown more cheerless than it did to
the Prince&#8217;s eyes when, six days before Christmas, he rode
in with his retreating army. The brief, sudden warmth of
the victory at Clifton was forgotten. They had travelled all
night, over distressing roads, fetlock deep in mud. They
were strained to breaking-point, after incessant marches, day
after day seeing the footmen cover their twenty miles with
bleeding feet. They were disillusioned, hopeless, sport for
any man to laugh at whose faith went no farther than this
world&#8217;s limits.</p>

<p>For the Prince, when he got inside the Castle, and gave
audience to Mr. Hamilton, the governor, there was worse
trouble brewing. Hamilton, caring only for the Stuart&#8217;s
safety, was resolute to hold Carlisle against the pursuing
Hanoverians, encamped at Hesket, within an easy day&#8217;s
march of the city. He pointed out, with a clear reasoning
beyond dispute, that the Castle was strong to stand a siege,
that the Duke of Cumberland would halt to capture it, knowing
it the key of the Border country, that a small garrison
could ensure the Stuart army a respite from pursuit until they
joined their friends in Scotland.</p>

<p>&#8220;I decline, Mr. Hamilton,&#8221; said the Prince sharply. &#8220;You
can hold out&mdash;for how long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a week at least, your Highness&mdash;ten days, may be.
They say the Duke has no artillery with him yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the end&mdash;the end will be the same, soon or late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A pleasant end, if it secures your safety. Oh, think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
your Highness! You&#8217;ve five thousand men with you, and we
are less than a hundred, all told. I tell you, I have thought
out all this. The garrison has thought it out, and&mdash;and we
are bent on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My men would not buy safety at the price. How could
they? No, no, Mr. Hamilton. Your garrison shall take
their chance in the open with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet that night the Prince could only sleep by snatches.
Throughout this swift campaign, opposed to all the prudences
of warfare, his thought that had been constantly for the welfare
of his soldiery, so far as he could compass it. And Hamilton
had planned a gallant chance of safety for them. Undoubtedly,
the plan was good.</p>

<p>To and fro his thoughts went, and they gained clearness as
the night went on. For himself, he had no care either way.
He had left hope behind at Derby, for his part. His heart
was not broken yet, but it was breaking; and, if he had
found leisure during this wakeful night for one private,
selfish prayer, it would have been that he might die at dawn,
facing the Duke&#8217;s motley army of pursuit. For the Prince
was not himself only, fighting his battle against circumstance
with a single hand; he was bone of the Stuart fathers who
had gone before, and death had always seemed as good a
friend as life, so long as it found him with straight shoulders
and head up to the skies.</p>

<p>There was the garrison here, resolved to die with gallantry.
There was his army, horsemen saddle-sore and footmen
going with bleeding feet for Stuart love. And one or other
must be sacrificed. It was no easy riddle for any man to
solve&mdash;least of all for a Prince whose soul knew deeper sickness
than usual men&#8217;s, whose body was racked by long riding
through wet roads. He had an aching tooth, moreover,
that moved him to get up at last, and light his black clay
pipe, and pace up and down the room allotted to him in the
castle.</p>

<p>He was no figure to entice the ladies who had danced with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
him, some months ago, at Holyrood. It was the man&#8217;s business
that claimed him now, and he fought out the battle of
Stuart pity against the bigger, urgent need.</p>

<p>At dawn he went down, and met the Governor coming up
the stair. &#8220;Your garrison can have their wish, Mr. Hamilton,&#8221;
he said quietly. &#8220;It seems the better of two evil
ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you spare twenty of your men, your Highness?
Some few of us have fallen sick since you marched south, and
we need strengthening.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Prince laughed, because pity and heart-sickness
compelled it. &#8220;I can spare anything just now,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;even to the half of my kingdom&mdash;the kingdom that Lord
Murray hopes to win for me in Scotland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are better days coming&mdash;believe me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day is enough for you and me, Mr. Hamilton. My
faith, thank God, teaches me so much, in spite of a raging
tooth.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went out, and in the courtyard encountered a friend
grown dear to him during a forward march and a retreat
that had given men opportunities enough to prove each
other. It was Colonel Towneley, whose name even before
the Rising had stood for all that Catholic Lancashire had
found likeable&mdash;Towneley, who had joined the southward
march with the loyal company known as the Manchester Regiment;
Towneley, who was resolute and ardent both, two
qualities that do not always run together. &#8220;Mr. Hamilton is
insistent to hold the Castle,&#8221; said the Prince, with the sharpness
that was always a sign of trouble on other folk&#8217;s behalf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your Highness. I learned yesterday that he&#8217;s of my
own mind. If a hundred men can save five thousand, why,
the issue&#8217;s plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He needs twenty volunteers to strengthen the garrison.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden light came into Towneley&#8217;s face&mdash;a light not to
be feigned, or lit by any random spark of daring that dates
no farther back than yesterday. &#8220;By your leave,&#8221; he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
quietly, &#8220;he needs nineteen only. I am privileged to be the
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince laid a hand on his shoulder. &#8220;Towneley, I
cannot spare you! Let younger men step in. There&#8217;s
Lochiel, and you, and Sir Jasper Royd, men I&#8217;ve grown to
love&mdash;I cannot spare one of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Towneley met the other&#8217;s glance and smiled. &#8220;I had a
dream last night,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, friend, it is reality to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me be, your Highness. Perhaps dreams and reality
are nearer than we think. I dreamed that I knelt with my
head on the block, and heard the axe whistle&mdash;and then&mdash;I
woke in Paradise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Towneley, you&#8217;re over-strained with all this devilish retreat&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon, but I speak of what I know. I woke in
Paradise, your Highness, and found leisure to think of my
sins. It was a long thinking. But there was one comfort
stayed by me&mdash;my Stuart loyalty. Look at it how I would,
there had been no flaw in it. The dream&#8221;&mdash;again the lightening
of the face&mdash;&#8220;the dream contents me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later they went out into Carlisle street. Wet and
chilly as the dawn was, both soldiery and townsfolk were
astir; and the Prince and Towneley, who had talked together
of things beyond this day&#8217;s needs, faced the buzz and clatter
of the town with momentary dismay.</p>

<p>The Prince was losing a friend, tried and dear; but he had
lost more at Derby, and dogged hardihood returned to him.
He looked at the way-worn men who faced him, eager to obey
the Stuart whom they idolised, wherever he bade them go.</p>

<p>&#8220;We march north to-day, leaving the garrison here,&#8221; he
said, a straight, kingly figure of surprising charm&mdash;charm
paid for in advance and royally. &#8220;There are twenty needed
to volunteer&mdash;for certain death, my friends. I have no lies
for you; and I tell you it is certain death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nineteen, your Highness,&#8221; corrected Towneley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>&#8220;Nineteen are needed. I forgot that Colonel Towneley&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He got no farther for a while. Wherever a man of Lancashire
stood, in among the crowd, a great cheer went up.
And Towneley, because he was human, was glad that these
folk, who knew his record, loved him quite so well.</p>

<p>What followed was all simple, human, soon over, as great
happenings are apt to be. There was Carlisle street, with its
gaping townsfolk, chattering foolishly and asking each other
how these restless Highlanders would affect the profits of
good shopkeepers; there was the Castle, set in a frame of
murky rain, and, in front of it, Prince Charles Edward, asking
for nineteen volunteers to follow Colonel Towneley&#8217;s
lead.</p>

<p>Even the townsfolk ceased balancing their ledgers. They
saw only one face in this crowded street&mdash;the Prince&#8217;s, as
he stood divided between high purpose and sorrow for the toll
of human sacrifice that is asked of all fine enterprises. They
saw him as he was&mdash;no squire of dames, good at parlour
tricks, no pretty fool for ballad-mongers, but a Christian
gentleman, with sorrow in his eyes and a hard look of purpose
round about his mouth and chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Towneley,&#8221; the Prince was saying gravely, &#8220;your
gallantry has left me no choice in this. God knows how willingly
I&#8217;d take your place.&#8221; And then, because a full heart
returns to old simplicities, his voice broke and he stretched
out a hand. &#8220;Towneley,&#8221; he went on, in lowered tones,
&#8220;we&#8217;re in the thick of trouble, you and I, and yours is the
easier death, I think. I covet it&mdash;and Towneley, journeys
end&mdash;&mdash;you know the daft old proverb.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause. The rain dripped ceaselessly.
The wind struck sharp and cruel from the east, as
it can strike nowhere surely as in Carlisle and grey Edinburgh.
Yet no man heeded, for they knew that they had
royalty among them here. And Colonel Towneley, for his
part, began to sob&mdash;the tears coursing down his rugged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
weather-beaten face, not because he had to die within a week
or two, but because he was compelled to say good-bye to one
who, in conduct and in faith, seemed nearer to the stars than
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Towneley&#8221;&mdash;the Prince&#8217;s voice was raised again, for he
cared not who knew his old, deep-seated love of Lancashire&mdash;&#8220;Towneley,
I was taught as a lad to like your country.
Your men are loyal&mdash;your women ask it of you&mdash;but I warn
volunteers again that they go to certain death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just to another life, your Highness. I have no doubts;
believe me, I have none. In one place or another&mdash;why, we
shall see the Stuart crowned again. Sir, I thank God for
this privilege; it goes far beyond my own deserts.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then there was no more to be said. A great gentleman
had spoken, content to take death&#8217;s hand as he would take a
comrade&#8217;s; and when such speak, the lies and subterfuges
of common life drift down the wind like thistledown. The
townsfolk of Carlisle began to ask themselves if, after all,
they had balanced up their ledgers rightly. These gentry,
in the east wind and the rain, seemed to pass to and fro a
coinage, not of metal but of the heart. And the coinage
rang true.</p>

<p>Again there was a silence. And then the Prince asked
gravely who would volunteer for death. There was a noisy
press of claimants for the honour; but first among them was
Rupert, putting bulkier men aside as he forced his way forward
to the Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, your Highness,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;I was bred in
Lancashire, like Colonel Towneley, and I claim second
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221; asked two or three behind him jealously.</p>

<p>Rupert turned, with a grave, disarming smile. Past weaknesses,
past dreams of heroism, the slow, long siege of Windyhough,
went by him as things remembered, but of little consequence.
He felt master of himself, master of them all,
and with a touch of pleasant irony he recalled past days.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>&#8220;Because, gentlemen, I am God&#8217;s fool, and I know not
how to live, but I know how to die. That is the one trade
I&#8217;ve learned.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer. There could be no answer. This
man with the lean body and the purpose in his face was innocent
of guile, and fearless, and strangely dominant. And
then at last the Prince smiled&mdash;the fugitive, rare smile that
few had captured since Derby and retreat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you, sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;To know how to die&mdash;there
is no better trade to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Maurice pushed forward, eager for the forlorn hope,
and moved, too, by the old, abiding instinct to stand by and
protect his elder brother. And Sir Jasper, unswerving until
now, was moved by sharp self-pity. He had been glad that
Rupert should prove himself at heavy cost; glad that he himself
could surrender the dearest thing he had to the Prince&#8217;s
need; but all his fatherhood came round him, like a mist of
sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;One son is enough to give your Highness,&#8221; he said, with
direct and passionate appeal to the Prince. &#8220;I&#8217;m not too old
to help garrison Carlisle, and my wife will need a young arm
to protect her later on; let me take Maurice&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then the Prince found his full stature. In retreat,
in sickness of heart, under temptation to deny his faith in
God and man, the Stuart weighed Sir Jasper&#8217;s needs, found
heart to understand his mood, and smiled gravely. &#8220;There
are so many claimants, sir, that I shall not permit more than
one man from any house to share the privilege. As for
Maurice, I shall have need of him at my side&mdash;and of you&mdash;I
cannot spare you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tradesmen of Carlisle looked on and wondered. This
was no shopkeeping. From the sleet and the tempest that
had bred them, it was plain that these gentry had learned
knighthood. Jack Bownas, the bow-legged tailor, who had
held stoutly that kings and gentry were much like other men,
save for the shape of their breeks, was bewildered by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
scene in Carlisle&#8217;s ugly street. He was aware that men are
not equals, after all, that some few&mdash;gently or lowly born&mdash;are
framed to claim leadership by steadfastness of soul and
outlook. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to tailor for yond Prince,&#8221; he growled to
his neighbour.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve turned Charlie&#8217;s man?&#8221; the other answered,
dour and hard&mdash;a man who had yielded to north-country
weather, instead of conquering it. &#8220;For me, he&#8217;s a plain-looking
chiel enough, as wet and muddied-o&#8217;er as you and
me, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a man, or somewhere near thereby, and I build few
suits these days for men. I spend my days in cutting cloth
for lile, thin-bodied folk like ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a good customer o&#8217; yours, and there are more tailors
in Carlisle than one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack Bownas, prudent by habit, was loath to lose customers.
He pondered the matter for a moment. &#8220;Awa wi&#8217; ye,&#8221; he
said at last. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen the Prince. You may gang ower
to Willie Saunderson&#8217;s, if you wull. He makes breeks for
little-bodied men.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the tailor&#8217;s one and only gift to the Stuart, this surrender
of a customer; but, measured by his limitations, it
was a handsome and a selfless tribute to the Cause. Born to
another calling, he might, with no greater sacrifice, have set
his head upon the block.</p>

<p>And through all this to-and-froing of the townsfolk,
through the rain and the bitter wind and the evil luck, the
forlorn hope&mdash;twenty of them&mdash;halted at the gateway of the
Castle before going in.</p>

<p>Rupert turned round to grip his father&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Goodbye,
sir,&#8221; he said gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodbye, my lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that was all their farewell. No more was needed, for
all the rough-and-ready training of their lives at Windyhough
had been a preparation for some such gallant death
as this.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>Colonel Towneley marshalled his volunteers in front of the
gateway, and the bitter wind drove through them.</p>

<p>The Prince, with his shoulders square to the wind, took
the salute of men soon to die. And then he drooped a little,
as all his race did when they were thinking of the needs of
lesser men. &#8220;Friends,&#8221; he said, lifting his head buoyantly
again, &#8220;there&#8217;s no death&mdash;and by and by I shall be privileged
to meet you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Throughout this march to Derby, and back again to wet
Carlisle, there had been no pageantry to tempt men&#8217;s fancy.
There were none now. A score of soldiers, drenched to the
skin, went in at the Castle gateway, and the rain came down
in grey, relentless sheets. Prince Charles Edward, as he
moved slowly north at the head of his five thousand men, was
still fighting the raging toothache that the hardships of the
march had brought him. And toothache sounds a wild, disheartening
pibroch of its own.</p>

<p>The night passed quietly in Carlisle, and the garrison was
grave and business-like, as men are when they stand in face
of certain death and begin to reckon up their debts to God.</p>

<p>Colonel Towneley had persuaded Hamilton to get to bed
and take his fill of sleep, and had assumed command; and
about three of the morning, as he went his round, he came on
Rupert, standing at his post. Towneley had the soldier&#8217;s
eye for detail, and he glanced shrewdly at the younger man.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were the first to volunteer with me?&#8221; he asked, tapping
him lightly on the shoulder. &#8220;I remember your tired,
hard-bitten face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was my luck, sir&mdash;and I&#8217;ve had little until now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not be sentrying here. We&#8217;ve had no easy
march to-day. You had earned a night&#8217;s rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not need it. I asked to take my place here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Towneley looked him up and down, then tapped him lightly
on the shoulder. &#8220;By gad! you&#8217;ve suffered, one time or another,&#8221;
he said unexpectedly. &#8220;You&#8217;re young to have earned
that steady voice. Good-night, my lad.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>The next day was quiet in Carlisle, and the only news that
came into the Castle was that the Duke of Cumberland still
lay at Hesket, awaiting the implements of siege that were
slow in reaching him; but the day after he brought his men
into the city, and invested the town as closely as his lack of
artillery allowed. It was a mistaken move on his part, as
the shrewdest of his advisers pointed out to him; but the
Duke had answered all wiser counsels with the blunt assurance
that he had time to stay and butcher a few rebels here
in Carlisle by way of whetting his appetite for the pleasant
shambles to come afterwards in Scotland. And those few
who were English among his following were aghast at the licence
Cumberland allowed himself in speaking of enemies,
misguided to their view, but brave and honourable men, content
to face long odds.</p>

<p>And again there was quiet within the Castle. Two days
passed, and still the Duke was waiting for the artillery that
was forcing its way painfully through roads ankle-deep in
mud.</p>

<p>Rupert, for his part, was entirely at home with the work
asked of him. He was defending walls besieged, and nothing
in the world was happening, as at Windyhough; but his task
was easier here, because he had men to share the hardship
with him, because he did not need, day by day, to fight single-handed
against the sleep that had kept him company in Lancashire.</p>

<p>Hamilton, the Governor, and Colonel Towneley&mdash;seasoned
men both&mdash;were astonished by the toughness and knowledge
of defence shown by this lean-bodied lad whose energy seemed
tireless. And then they learned from one of the Lancashire
volunteers how he had kept Windyhough for the King,
and they told each other that it was hard on the lad to have
to face a second siege so soon.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one who should ride far,&#8221; said Towneley to the
Governor once, after Rupert had got up from dining with
them to take his post.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Hamilton, with tired mockery of the faith he
held&mdash;&#8220;as far as the stars, Towneley&mdash;on a winged horse&mdash;like
the Prince, God bless him! like Oliphant of Muirhouse&mdash;like
all the dreamers who think this world well lost for loyalty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re fools of the same breed,&#8221; put in the other
dryly. &#8220;No need to laugh at your own regiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t laugh! I&#8217;m tired&mdash;just tired, Towneley. I
tell you, this business of holding Carlisle, while you others
were facing the stark brunt of it, has made me peevish. I
shall be an old woman if Cumberland&#8217;s artillery does not
reach him soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Towneley filled his glass afresh, held it up to the light,
glanced across at the Governor with clear, unhurried comradeship.
&#8220;I know, Hamilton&mdash;I know. I&#8217;ve felt the same&mdash;since
Derby. The Prince has felt it. The Highlanders have felt
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were in the open,&#8221; growled Hamilton.</p>

<p>&#8220;In retreat, and asking battle all the while&mdash;battle that did
not come. And we were saddle-sore and wet, with an east
wind blowing through us. You were snug in Carlisle here,
Hamilton. I tell you so.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they came near to quarrel, as men do when their hearts
grow cramped from lack of action. And then Towneley
laughed, remembering his whole, round faith in this life and
the next.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re grown men,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and very near to death.
We&#8217;d best not quarrel, like children in the nursery.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day the garrison looked out on a gentle fall of
sleet that half hid the Duke&#8217;s investing army. It was the
day of Christmas, and those without might do as they
liked; but the Governor and Colonel Towneley were aware
that Catholic souls must keep the feast of great thanksgiving.</p>

<p>They made their rounds with no less zeal, but with greater
precision, maybe, knowing that the sword-hilt is fashioned like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
the Cross. And about seven of the evening they sat down&mdash;Rupert
with them, and all the gentry of the garrison who
could be spared&mdash;at the well-spread supper-board.</p>

<p>They were simple at heart, these revellers who had known
more fast than feast days lately. They had gone to Mass
that morning with thoughts of the Madonna, who had
changed the world&#8217;s face, giving men a leal and happy reverence
for their women-folk. They had remembered these
women-folk with a pang of tenderness and longing knowing
they would not see another Christmas dawn. But now they
sat down to supper with appetites entirely of this world and
a resolve to wear gay hearts on their sleeves.</p>

<p>It was an hour later that Hamilton, the Governor, rose
and passed his wine across a great jug of water that stood in
front of him. &#8220;To the King, gentlemen!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And, from the acclamation, it would have seemed they
toasted one who was firmly on the throne, with gifts to offer
loyalty. Instead, their King was an exile on French shores,
and the only gift he had for them was this grace they had
found to die selflessly and with serenity for the Stuart whom
they served.</p>

<p>For a doomed garrison, they had supped well; and when
Towneley got to his feet by and by and sang a Lancashire
hunting-song, all in the broad, racy tongue of the good county,
they called for another, and yet another. Discipline&mdash;of a
drastic sort&mdash;was waiting for them. Meanwhile, they were
resolved to take their ease.</p>

<p>And suddenly there was a knocking on the door, and then
a rattling of the latch, and the sound of stumbling feet outside.
And then the door opened, and into the middle of the
uproar and the laughter came a figure so ludicrous, so dishevelled,
that their merriment was roused afresh.</p>

<p>The man was dripping from head to foot&mdash;not with clean
rain, but with muddy water that streaked his face, his hands,
his clothes. And he stumbled foolishly as he moved to the
table, and, without a by-your-leave, poured himself a measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
of wine and gulped it down. Then he tried to straighten
himself, and looked round at the company.</p>

<p>&#8220;I carry dispatches, and&mdash;and I&#8217;m nearly done,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>There was no laughter now, for his weakness and his errand
dwarfed all comedy. It was Rupert, remembering long
years of hero-worship, who first saw through the dishevelment
and mud that disguised this comer to the feast. He crossed
to the messenger&#8217;s side, and poured out another measure for
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Oliphant of Muirhouse,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and&mdash;you
steadied me in the old days at Windyhough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant had the gift of remembering the few who were
conspicuously leal, instead of the many whose weakness did
not count in the strong game of life. &#8220;So you&#8217;ve found
your way, as I promised you?&#8221; he said, with a sudden smile.
&#8220;And it tastes sweet, Rupert? Gad! I remember my first
taste of the Road.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Oliphant, feeling his strength ebb, crossed to the
Governor and laid his dispatches on the table. He explained,
in the briefest way, that he had ridden across country from
Northumberland, changing horses by the way, had found Carlisle
invested, had been compelled, lacking the password, to
run a sentry through and afterwards to swim the moat.</p>

<p>With the singular clearness that, in sickness or in health,
goes with men who carry a single purpose, he gave one dispatch
into the Governor&#8217;s hand. &#8220;That is for you, sir. This
other must be carried forward to the Prince&mdash;must be carried
instantly. Its contents may alter the movements of the
whole army. The safety of his Highness is concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused a moment, daunted by a weakness extreme and
pitiful. &#8220;I had hoped to carry the message on myself, after
an hour&#8217;s sleep or two,&#8221; he went on; &#8220;but I&#8217;m as you see
me&mdash;there are times when a man can do no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor was moved by Oliphant&#8217;s childlike, unquestioning
devotion. The man stood there, drenched and muddied,
after a ride that would have broken most folk&#8217;s wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
carry any message on. He had passed through besieging
troops, and cooled his ardour in a moat whose waters were
nipped by a northeast wind. And yet he seemed to ask forbearance,
because he was not strong enough to ride out again
at dawn on the Stuart&#8217;s business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be easy, Mr. Oliphant,&#8221; said Hamilton. &#8220;I shall find
you a hard-riding messenger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliphant&#8217;s mind was clear as ever for the detail that every
man must watch whose heart is set on high adventure. He
looked round the board, and the face that claimed his glance
was Rupert&#8217;s. Sharp and clear, old scenes at Windyhough
recurred to him&mdash;the pretty, pampered mother, the weakling
heir who longed to prove himself, the memories of his own
unhappy boyhood that Rupert had stirred at every meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave, Mr. Hamilton,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall choose
my own messenger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor nodded gravely. &#8220;It is your due, sir&mdash;much
more than that is your due, if I could give it you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Jasper Royd is my friend&mdash;and he will be glad to
know that his son is trusted with dispatches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert took fire from the torch that this harassed messenger
had carried into Carlisle Castle. Not long ago he had
been a stay-at-home, fenced round with women and old men;
and now, by some miracle, he was chosen to ride hard through
open country.</p>

<p>Across his eagerness, across the free and windy gladness
that had come to him, there struck a chillier air; and he
stayed for a thought of comrades left in the rear-guard of
the action. It was the old, abiding instinct that ran with the
simple Stuart loyalty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Oliphant,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;we are waiting here for
certain death. I choose to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You choose to stay?&#8221; echoed Oliphant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I volunteered&mdash;because you must take these dispatches
north yourself. I tell you, sir, you must get free of
Carlisle. It is death to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>Oliphant&#8217;s failing strength rallied for a moment. He no
longer saw the strained, eager face of this youngster who
had given him hero-worship, who was pleading with him for
his own safety. Instead, he saw a mountain-burn, high up
on the braes of Glenmoriston, and a summer&#8217;s day lang syne
gone by, and one who walked with him. They had talked
together, he and she, and she had been kind and winsome,
but no more; and with that dream, high as the stars, yet
vastly human, had ended his foolish quest for happiness.</p>

<p>He saw her now with the young eyes that had sought
answering fire from hers and had not found response. He
saw the whaups wheeling and crying over their heads, heard
the tinkling hurry of the burn, the lilt of the breeze through
the heather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Death?&#8221; he said turning at last to Rupert. &#8220;My lad,
there are worse friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they came to see him, after he had fallen into a
chair, his arms thrown forward on the table, they found a
gash across his ribs, of which he had not spoken. He had
earned it during the encounter with the sentry, before he
swam the moat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard-bitten!&#8221; muttered the Governor, with frank
pleasure in the man. &#8220;Hard-bitten! The Prince is happy
in his servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>After they had carried the messenger to bed, the Governor
drew Rupert apart. &#8220;See here, boy,&#8221; he said sharply, &#8220;your
sense of honour is devilish nice, but it needs roughening just
now. You volunteered for death? Well, the order is countermanded&mdash;or,
maybe, death&#8217;s waiting for you close outside.
Anyway, you go out to-night&mdash;at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather see my duty that way, sir, if I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, to the deuce with your scruples! You&#8217;re young, and
think it a fine, happy business to die for the Prince. It&#8217;s
a braver thing to live for him&mdash;through the stark murk of it,
lad. Here are your dispatches.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor, at the heart of him, was glad to feel that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
this promising youngster, who had shown patience and gallantry
in siege, should have his chance of a run for liberty.
He hurried him out of the Castle and down to the edge of
the moat. The night was thick with sleet and wind, friendly
for the enterprise because it stifled sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can swim?&#8221; said the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Passably, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then slip in, and play about like a water-rat until you find
your chance to land between the sentries. Make your way
into the town and hire a horse at the first tavern. They do
not know you in Carlisle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, Mr. Hamilton?&#8221; asked Rupert, with the old
simplicity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I? I shall take care of my own troubles, lad. Meanwhile,
you&#8217;ve enough of your own to keep you busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The passage of the moat was cold enough to keep Rupert
intent on present business. The need afterwards to pick his
way between the sentries, who were cursing northern
weather, left him no time for thought of those he left behind
in Carlisle. And then he had to keep a steady head, a quiet,
impassive face, as he bargained with the host of the Three
Angels Tavern touching the hire of a horse to carry him on
an errand of gallantry to Gretna Green. He played his part
well, this heir of Sir Jasper&#8217;s, for the song of the open hazard
was lilting at his ears.</p>

<p>He left the town behind him, and got out into the desolate,
wild country that lay between Carlisle and the Border. Because
he had no thought whether his horsemanship were good
or bad, so long as it helped him along the track of a single
purpose, he rode easily and well. After the quiet of Windyhough,
after the surprising journey to Carlisle, the second
siege there, with nothing happening, there was a keen, unheeding
freedom about this northward ride. He knew the
Prince&#8217;s route, had only to spur forward on the Annan road
to overtake him, soon or late. He was wet to the skin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
not strong of body; but his soul, like a steady, hidden lamp,
warmed all this enterprise for him. His one trouble was that
his borrowed nag was carrying a clinking shoe.</p>

<p>As he crossed the bridge at Gretna he heard two horses
splashing through the sleety track in front, and wondered
idly who were keeping him company on such an ill-found,
lonely road. When he got to the forge, intent on having his
horse re-shod, he saw the rough figure of the smith standing
swart against the glow from the open smithy door, fronting
a man good to look at and a woman whose face was shrouded
by a blue-grey hood.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky I was late with my work, and hammering half
into the night,&#8221; the smith was saying. &#8220;The fees are double,
sir, after it strikes midnight,&#8221; he added, with true Scots caution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Treble, if it pleases you. Marry us, blacksmith, and
don&#8217;t haggle. We&#8217;ve no time to waste.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they turned, man and wife, to get to saddle again,
they saw Rupert waiting, his arm slipped through his horse&#8217;s
bridle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck to you both!&#8221; he said, with the easiness that
sat well on him these days. &#8220;My need is to have a loose
shoe set right&mdash;and I, too, have no time to waste.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bride lifted her blue-grey hood and glanced at him,
aware of some romance deeper than her own that sounded
in the voice of this slim, weather-beaten stranger. &#8220;Dear,
will you ask a favour of this gentleman?&#8221; she said, touching
her bridegroom&#8217;s arm. &#8220;He wishes us luck, and he has a
loose horseshoe to give us. He comes in a good hour, I
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert stooped. The shoe came easily away into his hand,
and the bride, as she took it from him, looked up at him as if
she had known him long and found him trusty. &#8220;You carry
the luck-giver&#8217;s air,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have seen it once or twice,
and&mdash;it cannot be mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>&#8220;Likely,&#8221; said Rupert, with a touch of the old bitterness.
&#8220;I have found little of my own&mdash;till lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as for luck,&#8221; put in the blacksmith dryly, &#8220;I fancy
you&#8217;ve all three got more than the poor fools who came this
way five days ago. Five thousand o&#8217; them, so it was said&mdash;five
thousand faces that looked as if they were watching their
own burial&mdash;and the pipes just sobbing like bairns left out i&#8217;
the cold, and the Pretender with his bonnie face set as grim
as a Lochaber blade&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince&mdash;have you later news of him?&#8221; asked Rupert
indifferently, as if he talked of the weather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whisht, now! We have to call him the Pretender, whatever
a body may think privately. Yes, I&#8217;ve news of him&mdash;news
comes north and south to Gretna, for it&#8217;s a busy road.
They tell me he&#8217;s in Glasgow, and minded to bide there for
a good while.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bridegroom laughed&mdash;the low, possessive laugh of
pride that is the gift of newly-wedded males. &#8220;Princes come
and go, but a good wife comes only once. Good-night to you,
for we&#8217;re pursued.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bride gave Rupert a long, friendly look as she turned
to get to saddle. &#8220;I thank you for your luck, sir,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>It was so they parted, not to meet again; but Rupert, as
he waited restlessly until his horse was shod, was aware that
this lady of the grey-blue hood had loosened his grim hold of
life a little, because some note in her voice, some turn of the
pretty head, had reminded him of Nance Demaine&mdash;Nance,
half-forgotten, pushed into the background of this ride perilous
that was to give him manhood at long last. And a sudden,
foolish longing came to him to be at Windyhough again,
seeing Nance come into a dull room, to make it, by some
magic of her own, a place full of charm and melody.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say the Duke of Cumberland is staying to take
Carlisle, sir,&#8221; said the blacksmith, putting the finishing touches
to his work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. So they told me when I rode through to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>&#8220;Well, it gives these other chiels a chance, and I&#8217;m no
saying I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said Rupert as he got to saddle, and pressed a
crown-piece into the blacksmith&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>As he rode forward through the sleet, and was half-way to
Annan in the Border country, a horseman, better mounted
than himself, overtook him and drew rein sharply. There
was a ragged sort of moonlight stealing through the darkness
of the night, and he saw the face of a man, elderly and
hard and in evil temper, peering at him through the gloom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m seeking my daughter, sir,&#8221; said the stranger, without
preamble of any kind. &#8220;She was married at Gretna just now&mdash;I
was too late to stop that&mdash;but I trust to make her a
widow before the night is out. Have they passed you on the
road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was she wearing a grey-blue hood, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know? Have they passed you, I say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I watched them married at Gretna not long ago,
and they rode out ahead of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On which road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They spoke&#8221;&mdash;even a white lie came unreadily to Rupert&#8217;s
tongue&mdash;&#8220;they spoke of turning right-handed towards
Newcastle, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then the stranger turned his horse sharply round, swore
roundly at his informant, and was gone without a good-night
or a word of thanks. And Rupert laughed as he trotted forward.
He had faced many things during his odd, disastrous
five-and-twenty years&mdash;loneliness hard to bear, good-humoured
liking that was half-contempt from the men who
counted him a scholar, distrust and loathing of himself. But
now he felt strength come into his right hand, as a sword-hilt
does. His feet were set on the free, windy road. He
had gone a little way to prove himself, and the zest of it was
like rare wine, that warms the fancy but leaves both head
and heart in a nice poise of sanity.</p>

<p>He thought of the lady in the grey-blue hood, and laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
again. He knew now why he had lied to the pursuer. They
were night-riders, like himself, she and her groom; they had
chosen the honest open, with peril riding hard behind them.
And, till he died, his sympathy would ever go out now to
those who took the dangerous tracks.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>THE GLORY OF IT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Prince stayed in Glasgow with his army until the New
Year was two days in. And this was fortunate for Rupert,
because it enabled him to bring in his dispatches&mdash;after many
a change of horses by the way&mdash;in time to share the pleasant
victory of Falkirk later on.</p>

<p>And Falkirk Battle, like Prestonpans at the beginning of
this wild campaign, showed the Prince quick in strategy beforehand,
hot when the fight was dinning round his ears.
By sheer speed of generalship he got his army to the rising
ground which gave him the advantage, outwitting General
Hawley, who led the Hanoverian army. And then news was
brought&mdash;by Rupert, as it chanced&mdash;that Hawley could not
get his cannon up within firing distance, because the bogland
was so sodden that the wheels were axle-deep in mire. And
so then the Prince, against Lord Murray&#8217;s text-book warnings
and advice, ordered a sharp attack. They had the advantage
of the hill; but the Prince, knowing the temper of his Highlanders,
chose to abandon that for the gain of instant action.
He was justified. His men were like dogs kept too long upon
the chain, savage for assault; and, when he led them down
the hill, straight on to the astonished enemy&mdash;busy still with
the foundered gun-carriages&mdash;the roar and speed of the attack
swept all before it.</p>

<p>The fight was quick and bloody, till gloaming ended it.
The odds were three to two against the Prince; yet when the
day&#8217;s business was accomplished, there were six hundred
killed of Hawley&#8217;s army, and many wounded asking for the
succour which the Stuart gave by habit, and much artillery
and ammunition captured.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>It was in these days that Rupert found recompense for the
way for once, had faced the opposing odds with the practical,
quiet courage, the eager hope, that are seldom blended to
a nicety in a man&#8217;s soul.</p>

<p>And while they rested after the battle, news came in that
General Hawley&#8217;s army had been increased by three thousand
troops sent by forced marches from Northumberland.
Lord Murray&#8217;s arithmetic again took panic; the Prince&#8217;s
zeal caught fire; and once more, in this bloodless battle of
the council-chamber, it was the Scots prudence that won the
day.</p>

<p>The Prince&#8217;s army moved north, in retreat when advance
was their master-card to play. And again the Highland
pipers played sorrow round the hills, as if a mist came down.
And Rupert found his strength come supple to him, like a
well-tried sword, because in the years behind he, too, had
known retreat.</p>

<p>They went north, and farther north, up into the beautiful,
wild glens that now were harsh with winter, though
the hill-bred men liked the naked pastures, the naked, comely
trees, a little better than when the warmth of summer clothed
them.</p>

<p>It was not a battle, but a rout. The Prince had had his
years behind. Whenever a hazardous journey was planned,
needing one resolute man to follow it alone, the choice fell
on him. He had joined the honourable company of Night-Riders&mdash;those
messengers who were seldom in the forefront
of public applause, but whose service to the Cause was beyond
all praise or recompense. There were some twenty of them,
scattered up and down the two countries. Oliphant of Muirhouse,
Rupert&mdash;each one of them was of the same build and
habit&mdash;lean, untiring men who had earned their optimism by
the discipline the slow-working mills of God had taught them&mdash;men
who feared sloth, self-pity, prudence; men with their
eyes ever on the hills, where strength and the royal courage
thrive.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>Rupert had waited for his manhood; and now it grew to
flower with amazing speed and certainty. The muddled years
behind, the scholarly aloofness from life&#8217;s warfare and its
seeming disillusions, grew faint and shadowy. He went
about the Prince&#8217;s business, a man carrying men&#8217;s lives, and
the joy of it was as if the pipes called him up and down the
broken country to swift and pleasant battle.</p>

<p>He learned much these days, as men do who ride with the
lone hand on the bridle-rein&mdash;learned to keep his body hard,
and his soul clean, because he was adventuring, not his own
safety, but that of comrades who trusted him. Trust? As
he rode through the lonely glens, seeing past days and future
spread out before him like a clear-drawn map, he grew
more and more aware that there is no stronger stirrup-cup for
a rider-out to drink than the waters of deep trust. A man&#8217;s
faith in himself grows weak, or arrogant, or hardened; but
the high trust given him by others, who look to him and cannot
see him fail, is like a fixed star shining far ahead.</p>

<p>It was no easy life, as ease is counted. The year was getting
on to spring, as they reckon seasons London way; but
here among the mountains winter was tarrying, a guest who
knew his welcome long outstayed, and whose spite was
kindled. Night by night, as Rupert went by the lonely
tracks, the wind blew keen and bitter from the east; and
snow fell often; and rheumatism, sharp and unromantic, was
racking his wet body. Yet still his knees were firm about
the saddle, his handling of the reins secure; for he was learning
horsemanship these days.</p>

<p>And sometimes, at unlikeliest moments, there came a brief,
bewildering summer to his soul. He knew that Nance was
thinking of him&mdash;was trusting him, as all these others did.
He would see the moors and the denes that had bred him&mdash;would
hear the pleasant folk-speech of Lancashire, as he
passed greeting with farmers on the road&mdash;would remember
the way of his heart, as it leaped out to Nance in the old,
unproven days. These were his intervals of rest; for God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
lets no man&#8217;s zeal consume him altogether, until his time is
ripe to go. And then he would put dreams from him, as if
they were a crime, and would touch his pocket to learn if the
dispatches were secure, and would ride forward, carrying his
life through the winding passes, through the Scottish caution
of lairds who were doubtful whether it were worth while to
join a Prince in hot retreat.</p>

<p>It was so he came to Culloden Moor&mdash;wet, rheumatic, and
untiring&mdash;on the Fifteenth of April, and had audience of the
Prince. He had come from the north side of the River Spey,
and was ignorant that the enemy, under the Duke of Cumberland&#8217;s
command, was encamped not far away, ready to give
battle on the morrow.</p>

<p>The Prince acknowledged Rupert&#8217;s coming with a quick,
friendly smile. &#8220;Ah, you, sir! You&#8217;re the pick of my gentlemen
since Oliphant of Muirhouse died.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Rupert, forgetting that he had ridden far, carrying
urgent news, was aghast that one who had fed his boyish
dreams&mdash;one who had brightened the hard face of endeavour
for him&mdash;should have gone out of reach of human touch and
speech. &#8220;He&#8217;s dead, your Highness? I&mdash;I loved him,&#8221; he
said brokenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then be glad,&#8221; said the Prince, as if he talked gently to
a younger brother. &#8220;He died in Carlisle Castle, after a cruel
ride on my behalf. But he was not taken, sir, as all the others
were. There was Colonel Towneley there&mdash;a comrade I had
proved&mdash;and they tell me he&#8217;s on his way south to Tower Hill.
I would rather die as Oliphant&mdash;God rest him!&mdash;died.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert, blind and heart-sick, fumbled for his dispatches&mdash;dispatches
that, twice to-day, had all but cost him his life&mdash;and
handed them to the Prince, who turned them over carelessly
and put them down.</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave,&#8221; said the Prince, with a quiet laugh, &#8220;these
can wait a little. There&#8217;s battle on the moor to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Rupert learned what was in the doing; and his first
grief for Oliphant grew dulled, because the chance of open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
fight had come, after incessant riding through the nights that
had brought him little company.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, you&#8217;ll need rest!&#8221; said the Prince, with a kindly
touch on his arm.</p>

<p>And again Rupert smiled, with disarming frankness. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
had five-and-twenty years of rest, your Highness. It is better
to be up Culloden braes to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gad, sir! you&#8217;re Oliphant&mdash;just Oliphant, come to life
again, with all his obstinate, queer zeal. Make your peace,
lad, and sleep a while&mdash;we come into our kingdom either way
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through that night, in between the slumber that was forced
on him by sheer weight of tiredness, Rupert held fast the last
words of the Prince. It was their strength&mdash;the Stuart&#8217;s
strength and his, that, either way, they came into their kingdom.
The Georgian troops, sleeping or waking till the dawn&#8217;s
bugle notes rang out, had only one way of victory; they must
conquer, or lose all, in this world&#8217;s battle; it was a sealed riddle
to them that a man may find true gain in loss.</p>

<p>The dawn came red and lonely over Culloden Moor, and the
austere hills, as they cleared their eyes of mist-grey sleep,
looked down on a fury in the making, on preparations for a
battle whose tragedy is sobbing to this day.</p>

<p>Rupert, his heart on fire as he went through that day&#8217;s
eagerness&mdash;the Prince, who found recompense in action for
the indignities of Derby&mdash;the Highlanders, who were fighting
with the zest of children dancing round a village Maypole&mdash;could
never afterwards reconstruct the sharp and shifting issues
of the battle, could not guess how it came that all their
gallantry, their simple hope, were broken by the stolid foreign
soldiery.</p>

<p>Even at the bridge, where they came on with shield and
dirk and claymore against the Duke&#8217;s three lines of musketry&mdash;the
first line kneeling, the second stooping, the third standing
to full height&mdash;when they lay in tangled, writhing heaps,
shot down at twenty paces, those of the Highlanders whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
eyes were clear above disasters of the body were surprised
that love of their Prince had not disarmed the musketry; and
they tried to get up again, and died in the simple faith that had
taught them how to fight and how to die.</p>

<p>The Prince galloped up to the company of MacDonalds,
who had stood sullenly aloof because, at the beginning of the
fight, they had not been given the first post of danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;MacDonalds!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Who comes with me to the
bridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>They forgot their sulkiness, forgot allegiance to their chieftain.
There was the Stuart here, his face crimsoned by a
glancing musket-shot, his voice alive and dominant. From
frank disaster, from toothache and the miry roads, from this
day&#8217;s battle, which had found him skilled in fight, he had
learned his kingship.</p>

<p>The MacDonald turned sharply round, putting himself between
his clansmen and the Prince. &#8220;We stay,&#8221; he said, with
peremptory and harsh command. &#8220;They would not give us
the right wing of the battle&mdash;we&#8217;ll take no other.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince saw them halt in the midst of their eager rush
to serve him&mdash;saw them look at each other, waver, and stand
still. A call stronger than his own had come to them&mdash;the
call that is in each man&#8217;s blood, blowing willy-nilly like the
wind and bidding him obey the teaching of dead forefathers.
Their hearts were toward the Prince&mdash;they hungered for this
onset at the bridge&mdash;but they held back, just as at Derby, because
old allegiance was demanded by their chieftain.</p>

<p>&#8220;MacDonalds!&#8221; cried the Prince again, with desperate
eagerness. &#8220;Who&#8217;s for the bridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, before he guessed their purpose, some of his gentlemen
rode close about him, clutched his reins, compelled
him to desert the field.</p>

<p>&#8220;All&#8217;s lost, your Highness&mdash;except your safety,&#8221; said one.</p>

<p>He struggled to get free of them. &#8220;My pleasure,&#8221; he said
hotly, &#8220;is to die as poorer friends are doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>They would not listen. Their love of him&mdash;whether it took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
a misguided form or no&mdash;compelled them to use force, to disregard
commands, entreaties. His vision, maybe, was clearer
than their own. They were concerned with his immediate
welfare, could not look into the years ahead that were to be a
lingering, heart-broken death, instead of the pleasant end he
craved.</p>

<p>They got him to a place of safety, and he glanced at them
with a reproof so sad and desolate that for the first time they
doubted their own wisdom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, it was not well done,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but one day,
if God wills, I shall forgive you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Below them, the Duke of Cumberland had his way with the
broken Highlanders. Across the moor, and back again, his
troopers swept, till the field was like a shambles. The Highlanders
disdained to ask for quarter; the others were too drunk
with lust of slaughter to think of it; and the roll-call of the
dead that day among the clans was a tribute to the Stuart and
their honour. There were near a quarter wounded; but these
were outnumbered by the dead.</p>

<p>And yet the Duke had not supped well enough. In his
face, as he rode up and down the field, was a light not good
for any man to see&mdash;the light that had touched it dimly when
he laid siege to Carlisle and talked of whetting his appetite
by slaughter of its garrison.</p>

<p>He was unsatisfied, though the wind came down from the
moor and sobbed across the desolation he had made. He
checked his horse, pointed to the wounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dispatch these rebels, gentlemen,&#8221; he said to the officers
about him.</p>

<p>And then, as at Carlisle, the English among his following
withdrew from the uncleanness of the man. &#8220;We are officers,
your Highness,&#8221; said one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, and gentlemen. I know your ladylike speech. For
my part, I&#8217;m a soldier&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A butcher, by your leave,&#8221; snapped the other.</p>

<p>The Duke turned savagely on him; but the English closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
round their comrade, and their meaning was plain enough to
be read.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must I do the work myself?&#8221; he snarled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would seem so, if it must be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>And afterwards the gloaming, sad and restless, crept down
from the grey hills, shrouding the dead and wounded. It
found Cumberland master of the field; but he was surfeited,
and the true luck of the battle was with those who had died
in faith, or with those others of the Prince&#8217;s army who were
seeking cover among the northern hills. For it is not gain
or loss that matters, but the cleanly heart men bring to acceptance
of the day&#8217;s fortune.</p>

<p>Among the fugitives were some of the men of Lancashire
who had ridden out to join the Prince at Langton; and these
foregathered, by some clan instinct of their own, in a little
wood five miles away from the trouble of Culloden Moor.
Sir Jasper was there, and Rupert, and Maurice, all carrying
wounds of one sort or another. Demaine&#8217;s bailiff was there,
untouched and full of grumbles as of old. But Squire Demaine
himself was missing, and young Hunter of Hunterscliff;
and Maurice told how he had seen them die, close beside
him, at the ditch that lay fifty paces from Culloden Bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;God rest them!&#8221; said Sir Jasper, not halting for the sorrow
that would come by and by. &#8220;They&#8217;ve done with trouble,
friends, but we have not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half that night they rested in the sodden wood, with a chill
wind for blanket; but they were afoot again long before dawn,
and overtook the Prince&#8217;s company at Ruthven. A council
was held just after their arrival, and the Prince&mdash;who, before
ever Culloden battle found him in the thick of it, had not slept
for eight-and-forty hours&mdash;was still solicitous touching the
welfare of his friends. He bade the native-born make for
their own homes, the English choose the likeliest road to safety
that offered; for himself, he would keep a few friends about
him, and would take his chance among the hills. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
his gentlemen demurred, wishing to remain, he faced them
with the pleasant humour that no adversary could kill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not permitted to command when we were in advance,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;but, gentlemen, we&#8217;re in retreat&mdash;and surely
I may claim the privilege?&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had gone their separate ways in little companies&mdash;reluctantly,
and looked backward at the Stuart, who was
meat, and wine, and song to them&mdash;the Prince himself was
left with ten gentlemen about him. Nine of them were Scotsmen,
but the tenth was Rupert, who had a surprising gift these
days for claiming the post of direst hazard.</p>

<p>And through that sick retreat the scattered companies were
aware of the qualities that disaster brings out more clearly
than any victory can do. Oliphant of Muirhouse, dead for
the Cause and happy in the end he craved, had asked Sir Jasper
long ago at Windyhough if Will Underwood, brave in the
open hunt, were strong enough to stand a siege; and these
fugitives, going east and west and north&mdash;hopeless and spurred
forward only by the pursuit behind, the homesickness ahead&mdash;were
aware, each one of the them, what Oliphant had meant.</p>

<p>The Highlanders, trudging over hill-tracks to their shieldings,
were buried in a mist of sorrow, that only battle could
disperse. Lord Murray, riding for his own country, was reflective,
soured, and peevish, because his cold arithmetic of
war was disproven by results. Yet, through the disillusion
and weariness of this wild scamper for the hills, the strong
souls of the Rising proved their mettle. The Prince, Lochiel,
the good and debonair, Sir Jasper and his hunting men of
Lancashire&mdash;those who had lost most, because their hope had
been most keen, were the strong men in retreat.</p>

<p>And Rupert, sharing the Prince&#8217;s dangers and his confidence
more closely every day, rode up and down among the
hills like a man possessed by some good angel that would not
let him fear, or rest, or feel the aches that wet roads by day,
wet beds by night entailed on him. Whenever a messenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
was needed to go into dangerous country and fear nothing,
he claimed first privilege; and it was granted him, for he had
learned a strange persuasiveness.</p>

<p>He was at Benbicula with the Prince, where they and the
crew of a small boat that had landed them met a storm of
rain that was to last for fourteen hours; where they found an
empty cottage, with a store of firelogs; where the Prince
bought a cow for thirty shillings, and proved himself the best
cook of them all. They had food that night, and a bottle of
brandy among the six who still kept company together; and
these unwonted luxuries brought the best gift of all&mdash;sleep,
that is dear to buy when men have kept weariness at bay too
long.</p>

<p>Rupert was at Corradale, too, where for three weeks they
found safety among the islanders of Uist. The royal baggage
was no heavier than a couple of shirts, and the Prince
was housed in a byre so weather-rotted that he had to sleep o&#8217;
nights under a tent made of branches and cow-hides, to keep
the rain from him. Yet his cheerfulness was unfeigned, for
he was tired of prudence and spent his whole days hunting
deer on the hills or fishing in the bay. The Uist folk knew
him, and the price upon his head; the neighboring isles were
thick with soldiery in pursuit, and gunboats were busy among
the inland seas; and yet he moved abroad as if he were some
big-hearted country gentleman, intent only on following his
favourite sports in time of peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wear a charmed life, your Highness,&#8221; said Rupert,
as they came down one day from shooting deer. It was near
the end of their three weeks&#8217; sojourn on the island, and the
danger set so close about the Prince had harassed him, as no
perils of his own could do.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you, sir,&#8221; said the other, turning suddenly. &#8220;I
bear a charmed life. So does any man for whom God finds a
need. We die, I think, when our work is done, but not an
hour before.&#8221; And with that he laughed, and got out his
clay pipe. &#8220;We shall sup on venison to-night, my friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
and I am hungry. You should not tempt me with matters of
theology.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it was afterwards, when they left Uist to go through
constant perils, by land and sea. The Prince brought to it
all&mdash;discomfort, pursuit outwitted by a hair&#8217;s breadth time
after time&mdash;the same unyielding outlook. Fools and cowards
might fold their hands, reconstructing yesterday and bewailing
all the misadventures that might have been avoided had
they done this, done that; but the Stuart took life up from each
day&#8217;s beginning, and went forward, praying in entire simplicity
that his shoulders might be broadened to the coming
burden.</p>

<p>When at last, near the end of June, they came near the Skye
country, a new, surprising page was turned of the story of
these hunted folk. Until now they had been among men,
fighting the enemy at Culloden, eluding him during the incessant,
long retreat. But now a woman stepped into their
lives again; and, because faith and old habit had trained them
that way, they were glad that a thread of gold had come to
bind the rough wounds of life together.</p>

<p>Not till he died would Rupert forget those days in the Western
Isles. Their grace passed into abiding folksong before
the year was out; and he was privileged to watch, step by step,
the growth of a high regard such as the world seldom sees.</p>

<p>He saw Flora MacDonald&#8217;s first coming to the Prince&mdash;at
Rossinish, in Uist&mdash;saw the long, startled glance they exchanged,
as if each had been looking for the other since time&#8217;s
beginning. And then he saw her curtsey low, saw him lift
her with tender haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should kneel to you instead, Miss MacDonald,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve volunteered to be my guide through dangerous seas,
they tell me, and I fear for your safety, and yet&mdash;I ever liked
brave women.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert had changed his trade of messenger for that of boat-man,
and was one of the six rowers who rested on their oars
in the roomy fishing-coble that was waiting to carry the Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
to Skye. There was a wild gale blowing, but the June night
was clear with a sort of tempered daylight, and Rupert
watched these two, standing on the strip of sandy shore, with
a queer sense of intuition. The discipline of night-riding, its
loneliness and urgency, teaches a man to look on at any happening
with eyes keen for the true, sharp detail of it; and the
two figures, as he saw them now, seemed transfigured, secure
for the moment in some dream of a past life they had shared
together.</p>

<p>There was the Prince, his head lifted buoyantly, his lips
smiling as if Culloden had never been. There was Miss MacDonald&mdash;four-and-twenty,
keen for loyalty and sacrifice&mdash;with
something more than loyalty making a happy light about her
face. She had none of the fripperies that set men&#8217;s wits
astray and poison their clean hold on life; but, from her buckled
shoes to her brown, shapely head, she was trim, and debonair,
and bonnie, made to keep pace with men along the road
of high endeavour.</p>

<p>Rupert, resting on his oar, felt a touch of loneliness and
heartache. This lass of MacDonald&#8217;s recalled the Lancashire
hills to him because she was so like Nance Demaine, for whose
sake he was proving himself along the troubled ways. And
then he had no time for heartache; for the Prince was handing
Miss MacDonald into the boat, and the rowers were bidden
to make for the first unguarded landing-place in Skye
which they could find.</p>

<p>They had an evil passage. The wind never ceased to wail
and scream across the foamy breakers, but the storm was not
dark enough to hide them, and in the half-light their boat
showed clear against the grey-blue of the heaving seas.
Gunboats were out, searching for the fugitive, who was known
to be somewhere in among the isles; and once a hail of shot
passed over them from a man-of-war that set sail in pursuit,
but could not take them because the wind was contrary.</p>

<p>For eight hours the rowers strove with the long passage
overseas from Uist, their arms unwearying at the oars. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
the Prince would take more than his share of the toil, telling
them that he was the cause of this night voyage and should
lend a willing hand on that account. They came to Skye at
long last, and tried to put in at Waternish on the west coast,
but found a company of soldiery encamped about a roaring
fire, and had to put back again into the teeth of the wind.
And, as if wind and seas were not enough, the men on shore
pursued them with a rousing volley. One bullet struck the
boat&#8217;s side, and a score others hit the water close about them,
and rebounded, and went out across the waves with a
sharp, mournful wail, shrill as the pipes when they are sorrowful.</p>

<p>No one on board was hit; but the Prince, seeing Miss MacDonald
shrink, put out a hand and touched her, as a devout
lover might. And the two took hurried counsel. It seemed
best to cross Snizort Loch, and so reach Monkstadt, where a
kinsman of her own would give them shelter&mdash;unless there,
too, the soldiery were quartered.</p>

<p>The Prince wished once again to take an oar, though his
hands were raw and bleeding; but no man would give up the
rowing that, for sake of him they carried, was pleasant to
them; and so, lest he should be idle altogether, he sang old,
loyal songs to them, and jested, and made their burden lighter&mdash;a
gift of his. And then Miss MacDonald, whose pluck was
not to be denied, broke down for a little while, because she
was spent with endeavour and the wild tumult of the Stuart&#8217;s
coming. And Rupert, tugging at his oar, watched the Prince
persuade her to lie down in the bottom of the coble, saw him
take off his plaid and cover her with practical and quiet solicitude,
as if he had the right to guard her.</p>

<p>And through the rest of that night-crossing the Prince kept
stubborn guard about his rescuer, who was sleeping now like
a child, lest any of the rowers should touch her with his foot
in moving up and down to ease his limbs. And Rupert,
though his wits were muddled with incessant toil by land and
sea, felt something stir at the soul of him, as he saw the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
of the Prince&#8217;s regard for this daughter of the MacDonalds.
Again it seemed to him that these two had known each other
long ago, before the world grew old, and tired, and prone to
gossip. And again he remembered Nance Demaine, who had
touched his boyhood with the fire that does not die.</p>

<p>They came to Monkstadt in safety, but learned that the
enemy was in possession of the house. And afterwards it was
to and fro on foot across the good isle of Skye, for many days,
until they came to the house of Kingsborough, where Flora&#8217;s
home was with her mother and stepfather.</p>

<p>It was a queer incoming, touched with laughter and the
needs of every day, as all big enterprises are until we view
them in the retrospect. There was Kingsborough&mdash;the biggest
of the big MacDonalds&mdash;going in before to prepare his
wife for the intrusion. And he was manifestly afraid, as the
big, open-air men are when they are dwarfed by house-walls
and the indoor cleanliness.</p>

<p>Kingsborough, after bowing the Prince into the square, tidy
hall, asked leave to go up and tell his wife the news. And
presently, from above stairs&mdash;while Flora and the Stuart
waited in the hall&mdash;the laird&#8217;s wife broke into practical and
shrill complaint.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the danger, Kingsborough; and, fore-bye, there&#8217;s
so little in the house. Collops, and eggs, and a dish of oatmeal&mdash;how
should I face the Prince, God bless him, with eggs
and collops?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince laughed suddenly. And Miss MacDonald,
standing apart with the unrest and trouble of her deepening
regard for the Stuart she had rescued, glanced across at him,
wondering that he could be gay; and then she laughed with
him, for the tart good-humour of her mother&#8217;s voice was practical,
and far removed from the glamour the two fugitives had
shared.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may face me, Mrs. MacDonald,&#8221; he said, going to
the stairfoot. &#8220;Collops and eggs are dainties to me these
days; and, indeed, I am very hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>So there was a hurried toilet made, and the mistress of the
house came down, half of her the laird&#8217;s wife, instinct with the
dignity that knows its station, the other half a picture of curiosity,
surprise, bewildered curtseys, because the Stuart claimed
her hospitality.</p>

<p>They supped that night as if they dined in state. To any
meal, to any company, the Prince brought that grace which is
not lightly won&mdash;the grace to touch common things with poetry,
and to make a dish of collops as proud as if it were a
boar&#8217;s head brought in to table by stately lackeys.</p>

<p>Rupert, supping with them, noted less the Prince&#8217;s great air
of ease&mdash;he was accustomed to it long ago&mdash;than the punctilious
and minute regard he showed to Miss MacDonald.
Whenever she moved to leave the room&mdash;intent on seeing to
the dishes in the kitchen&mdash;he rose and bowed her out. When
she returned, he rose, and would not be seated till she had
taken her place again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll turn poor Flora&#8217;s head, your Highness,&#8221; said Mrs.
MacDonald once, after Flora had gone out, some shrewd maternal
instinct warring with her loyalty.</p>

<p>&#8220;The head that guided me from Uist to Skye, and to your
hospitality, would not be lightly turned. I <i>choose</i> to honour
your daughter, Mrs. MacDonald, by your leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, your Highness, she&#8217;s only a daft slip of a girl. I
weaned and reared her, and should know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not cross with us from Uist. And afterwards
there were the days and nights in Skye, the rains, and the patient
watching; madam, as God sees us, Miss Flora carries
the bravest soul in Scotland. I cannot do her too much honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kingsborough, big and simple-hearted&mdash;his wife, thrifty
and not prone to sentiment&mdash;looked at their guest with frank
astonishment. He had been so gay, so debonair, until a
chance word had touched the depths in him. How could they
understand him? They had not been through the glamour
and wild seas, as he had been since Miss MacDonald came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
serve him. They did not know the clean, quick love that had
lain here in wait for him among the Western Isles.</p>

<p>Flora came in again, carrying a dish of hot scones. She
was aware of some new gravity that had settled on the company,
and her glance sought the Prince&#8217;s with instinctive question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I was praising Miss MacDonald in her
absence. You must forgive me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Late that night, when he and Rupert were alone with their
host, the Prince fell into a mood of reckless gaiety. For a
while his journeyings were ended. He had supped royally;
he was to enjoy the luxury of a mattress and clean sheets,
after many nights spent in the heather or in wave-swept
boats; and the sheer physical comfort of it was strangely
pleasant.</p>

<p>He was a good companion, with a story here, a jest there,
that set big Kingsborough laughing till he feared to wake the
goodwife up above. He taught the laird the true way of mixing
whisky-punch. He would not be cajoled to bed, because
the respite of this sitting beside a warm hearth, with friends
beside him and Miss MacDonald somewhere in the house, was
more than food and drink to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must make an early start to-morrow,&#8221; said Kingsborough,
when at last his guest rose. &#8220;It is imperative, your
Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, friend,&#8221; said the other, with pleasant unconcern.
&#8220;To-night I sleep&mdash;I tell you, I must sleep. The most willing
horse, Mr. MacDonald, has need of the stable in between-whiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew himself and his needs; and, with a purpose as settled
as his zeal at other times to undergo wakefulness and unremitting
hardship, he slept that night so deep that only armed
intrusion would have roused him.</p>

<p>Kingsborough and Rupert, pacing up and down below
stairs the next morning, were consumed with dread for the
Stuart&#8217;s safety. The laird&#8217;s wife feared every moment that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
the enemy would come battering at her door. Only Miss
MacDonald was cool and practical.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Highness has the gift of knowing when to keep
awake,&#8221; she said, a little undernote of pride and tenderness in
her voice&mdash;&#8220;the gift of knowing when to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>And her faith was justified. The Prince came down two
hours beyond the time that Kingsborough had planned&mdash;came
down with a light step, and a face from which sleep had wiped
away a year of sorrow. He bade farewell to the laird&#8217;s wife,
who was crying like a child to see him so pleasantly in love
with danger, and was turning from the door, when he began
to bleed at the nose. Kingsborough&#8217;s wife handed him a kerchief,
bewailing the ill omen.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the Prince, with unconquerable twisting of
crooked issues to a clean, straight shape. &#8220;The omen&#8217;s good.
Blood has been shed for me, and I&#8217;m paying a few of my
debts, Mrs. MacDonald. I should not like it to be said that I
left your Highland country a defaulter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three of them set out&mdash;the Prince, and Flora, and Rupert&mdash;and
Kingsborough turned suddenly from watching the
Stuart out of sight. &#8220;By God, wife,&#8221; he said suddenly,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve given houseroom to a man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s for death, Hugh,&#8221; the goodwife answered, her thrifty
mind returning to calculation of the odds against the fugitive.</p>

<p>Kingsborough took a wide look at the hills, where sun and
mist and shadows chased each other across the striding rises.
&#8220;Death?&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;It comes soon or late&mdash;but the soul
of a man outrides it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was on their way to Portree that the three fugitives
learned how clearly Miss MacDonald&#8217;s faith in her Prince had
been justified. They met a shepherd&mdash;Donald MacDonald by
name&mdash;who told them that, two hours before, &#8220;the foreigners&#8221;
had been up and down between Portree and Kingsborough,
searching for the Prince. They had left the island a
half-hour ago, he added, following some new rumour that his
Highness was still hiding in South Uist.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>&#8220;If I&#8217;d not slept so late, we should all three of us have been
taken, Miss MacDonald,&#8221; said the Prince, as they went forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trusted you,&#8221; she answered. And the quietness of her
voice rang like a bugle-call.</p>

<p>And Rupert, with that fine sixth sense that a man learns
from hazard and night-riding, knew that these two were talking
with the freemasonry of souls that have learned kinship
and proved it through long, disastrous roads.</p>

<p>They went to Portree, and found an eight-oared boat there,
with seven rowers in it. Rupert went on board, took his place
at the eighth oar. And again, as far away in Uist&mdash;and years
ago, it seemed&mdash;he watched the Prince and Miss MacDonald
foregathered on the shore. In Uist they had met, these two,
under a driving wind that blew across the tempered radiance
of the June night hours. Here they were standing in hot daylight,
with never a breeze to ruffle the happy face of land and
sea. And yet they had been glad in Uist, with the storm
about them; and here in Skye they stood, and looked at one
another, and were empty of all hope.</p>

<p>They had spent few days together, as time is reckoned, the
Prince and Miss MacDonald of the isles. But the days they
shared had been packed full of hardship, danger of pursuing
soldiery, peril of their warm, human liking for each other&mdash;the
human liking that gains depth and strength from trouble.
The Prince had gone through a Scotland set thick with women
who asked a love-lock, a glance, and all that follows. He had
kept troth instead with the stubborn march of men who followed
the open road with him. Women came before and
after strife&mdash;that had been his gospel, until he met Miss MacDonald,
good to look at, and brave to rescue him.</p>

<p>And now they stood together on the shore of Portree Bay.
They were Prince and loyal subject, and yet they were children
crying in the dark, needing each other, heart-sick at parting,
ready, if their faith had been a little weaker, to catch at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
the coward&#8217;s proverb that the world is well lost for a love forbidden.</p>

<p>To these two, parting on the edge of Portree Bay, there
came a sudden intuition of the soul. They saw&mdash;almost as if
it stood between them&mdash;a sword, keen-edged, and clean, and
silvery&mdash;the sword that had guarded them safely through
worse dangers than gunboats and the stormy seas. They saw
the days behind&mdash;the few days granted them for comradeship&mdash;the
years stretching out and out ahead, empty and steep and
wind-swept as the lone hill-tracks of Skye.</p>

<p>The rowers waited, impatient to be off, because each moment
lost was packed with danger. But these two would
never again fear any sort of hazard; they had gained too
much, were losing too much.</p>

<p>Their glances met. One was taking the high road trod by
the bleeding feet of royalty; the other was taking the low
road, that led to the house of Kingsborough, its maddening,
quiet routine of housewifery&mdash;mending of the laird&#8217;s stockings,
seeing that Mrs. MacDonald&#8217;s fowls were tended, going,
day by day, and year by year, through the sick, meaningless
routine of housework.</p>

<p>And one knew that, wherever his feet were planted, his
heart would return constantly to the misty isle that had taught
him the strong love and the lasting. And the other knew that
she would never cease to look out from Kingsborough&#8217;s windows,
when leisure served, and trick herself into the belief
that her man was returning&mdash;crowned or uncrowned, she
cared not which&mdash;was returning, with the wind in his feet and
the glad look in his face, to tell her all the things unspoken
during these last days of trial.</p>

<p>The sun beat hot on the rowers&#8217; backs, and this parting
seemed long to them. To Miss MacDonald and the Prince it
seemed brief, because the coming separation showed endless
as eternity.</p>

<p>And then at last the Prince stooped to her hand, and kissed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
it. &#8220;Your servant, Miss MacDonald,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;your servant
till I die, God knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert watched it all with eyes trained to understanding.
And, when the fugitives were aboard and they were straining
at their oars, he was sure that the Prince would give one long,
backward glance at Miss MacDonald. But the Stuart was
older to life&#8217;s teaching, and would not look behind when he
had chosen the plain road ahead. His eyes were set forward&mdash;forward,
over the dappled, summer seas, to the days of
hiding and unrest waiting for him. And through his bitterness
and lonely need for Miss MacDonald he found a keen,
high courage, as the man&#8217;s way is. And Flora MacDonald, as
the woman&#8217;s way is, watched the boat grow less and less until
it was a dark speck dancing on a sea of violet, and green, and
amethyst, and fought for the resignation that brings peace, but
never the trumpet-note of gladness that had kept her company
on the dangerous seas.</p>

<small>LOVE IN EXILE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Skye boatmen took their Prince safely to the mainland,
and were not ashamed because they wept at parting from him.
And then the Stuart and Sir Jasper&#8217;s heir set out again along
the lone tracks that taught them understanding of each other&mdash;understanding
of the world that does not show its face
among the crowded haunts where men lie and slander and
drive hard bargains one against the other. Their bodies were
hard, for wind and weather had toughened them till they were
lean and rugged as upland trees that have grown strong with
storm. Their courage was steady, because all except life was
lost. And at their hearts there was a quick, insistent music,
as if the pipes were playing. They were fighting against long
odds, and they were northern born; and the world, in some
queer way, went not amiss with them.</p>

<p>Rupert, in between the journeys and the vigils shared with
the Prince, was often abroad on the errands that had grown
dear to him since coming into Scotland. He would ride here,
ride there, with night and danger for companions, gathering
news of the enemies, the friends, who could be counted on.
And he found constantly the stirring knowledge that, though
he had not been keen to ride to hounds in Lancashire, he was
hot to take his fences now.</p>

<p>On one of these days he rode in, tired and spent, bringing
news from the braes of Glenmoriston, and found the Stuart
smoking his pipe, while he skinned a deer that he had shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are killing yourself for loyalty,&#8221; said the Prince,
glancing at him with a sudden, friendly smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave, sir,&#8221; said Rupert, as if he talked of Murray&#8217;s
plain arithmetic, &#8220;I am alive at last.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;re made of the martyr&#8217;s stuff,&#8221; said the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness, they called me the scholar there in Lancashire,
and I knew what that meant. I am trying to outride
the shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert was tired out. The Prince was tired at heart, because
of Culloden, because of Miss MacDonald, whom he was
not to see again, and all the dreams that had tumbled from
the high skies to sordid earth. Neither of them had tasted
food for six-and-thirty hours. And at these times men are
apt to find a still, surprising companionship, such as the
tramps know who foot it penniless along the roads.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have found our kingdom, you and I,&#8221; said the Prince,
with sudden intuition&mdash;&#8220;here on the upland tracks, where a
man learns something of the God who made him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert looked out across the mountains, blue-purple in the
gloaming, and caught the other&#8217;s mood, and spoke as a friend
does to a friend, when the heart needs a confidant. &#8220;It is all
a riddle,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;I thought all lost, after Culloden&mdash;and
yet I&#8217;ve tasted happiness, tasted it for the first time in my
life. To carry your life on the saddle with me, to keep open
eyes when I&#8217;m sick for sleep, to know that the Stuart trusts
me&mdash;I tell you, I have tasted glory.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince turned his head aside. This was the loyalty
known to him since he first set foot in Scotland, the service he
claimed, he knew not why, from gentle and simple of his well-wishers.
And he was remembering how many of these eager
folk had died on his behalf, was forgetting that he, too, had
gone sleepless through peril and disaster because he carried at
his saddle-bow, not one life only, but a kingdom&#8217;s fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your news from Glenmoriston, sir?&#8221; he asked sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleasant news. A man has died for you, with gallantry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You call it pleasant news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, your Highness! It was one Roderick MacKenzie&mdash;he
was a merchant in Edinburgh, and left the town to follow
you; and he found his way, after Culloden, to the hills about
Glenmoriston. He was alone, and a company of the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
surprised him; and he faced them, and killed two before they
overcame him; and he died in anguish, but found strength to
lift himself just before the end. He knew that he was like
you, in height and face, and cried, &#8216;God forgive you, you have
killed your Prince!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was brave; it was well meant. But, sir, it is not pleasant
news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He bought your safety. They are carrying his head to
London to claim the ransom. And the troops have left the
hills, your Highness&mdash;they believe you dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish their faith were justified,&#8221; said the other, with the
bitterness that always tortured him when he heard that men
had died on his behalf. &#8220;Your pardon,&#8221; he added by and by.
&#8220;I should thank you for the news&mdash;and yet I cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day they climbed the brae and went down the long,
heathery slope that took them to Glenmoriston; and nowhere
was there ambush or pursuit, as Rupert had foretold&mdash;only
crying of the birds on hilly pastures, and warmth of the July
sun as it ripened the ling to full bloom, and humming of the
bees among the early bell-heather.</p>

<p>They came to the glen at last, and ahead of them, a half-mile
away, there was blue smoke rising from the chimney of a
low, ill-thatched farmstead. And the Prince touched Rupert&#8217;s
arm as they moved forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, how hunger drums at a man&#8217;s ribs!&#8221; he said, with a
tired laugh. &#8220;If there were all the Duke&#8217;s army lying in wait
for us yonder, we should still go on, I think. There may be
collops there, and eggs&mdash;all the good cheer that Mrs. MacDonald
thought scanty when we came to the laird&#8217;s house at
Kingsborough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave,&#8221; said Rupert gravely, &#8220;it does not bear
speaking of. I begin to understand how Esau felt when he
sold his birthright for a mess of pottage.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reached the house, and they found there six outlaws
of the hills, ready with the welcome Rupert had made secure
before he led the Prince here. They had entrenched themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
in this wild glen, had ridden abroad, robbing with discretion,
but never hurting a man who was too poor to pay
tribute. Their name was a byword for cattle-lifting, and they
lived for plunder. Yet, somehow, when the Stuart came
among them, with thirty thousand pounds easy in the gaining,
they disdained blood-money.</p>

<p>For all that, another hope of the Prince&#8217;s crumbled and
went by him, after he had greeted his new hosts. There were
neither eggs nor collops in the house&mdash;only a dish of oatmeal,
without milk to ease its roughness. The Glenmoriston men
explained that Cumberland&#8217;s soldiery had been about the glen,
had raided their cattle and sheep, had laid bare the countryside.</p>

<p>&#8220;For all that,&#8221; said the Prince, unconquerable in disaster,
&#8220;I thank you for your oatmeal. As God sees me, you have
stilled a little of the ache I had.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Glenmoriston men liked the way of him. And
when, next day, he and Rupert went up the hills and stalked a
deer, and brought it home for the cooking, their loyalty was
doubled.</p>

<p>Through the days that followed the outlaws found leisure to
prove the guests they harboured. In the hill countries a man&#8217;s
reputation stands, not on station or fair words, but on the
knowledgable, quiet outlook his neighbours bring to bear on
him. And ever a little more the outlaws liked these two, who
were lean and hard and weather-bitten as themselves.</p>

<p>The Prince would not claim shelter in the house, because
long use had taught him to prefer a bed among the heather.
And Rupert, lying near by o&#8217; nights, learned more of the Stuart
than all these last disastrous days had taught him. When
a man sleeps in the open, forgetting there may be a listener,
he is apt to lose his hold on the need for reticence that house-walls
bring.</p>

<p>The Prince, half between sleep and waking, would lift himself
on an elbow, would murmur that men had died for him&mdash;men
better than himself, who had followed him for loyalty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
and not for hire, men whom he should have shepherded to
better purpose. And then he would snatch an hour or two of
sleep, and would wake again with a question, sharp and hurried
and unquiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Miss MacDonald? She&#8217;s in danger. The seas
are riding high&mdash;they&#8217;re riding high, I say!&mdash;and there&#8217;s only
my poor plaid to cover her.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it was always when the Prince rambled in his sleep.
There was never a complaint on his own behalf, never a wild
lament that he was skulking, a broken man, among the mountains
after coming near to London and high victory. He had
two griefs only, in the night hours that probe to the heart of
a man&mdash;passionate regret for the slain, passionate regard for
Miss MacDonald&#8217;s safety.</p>

<p>And once the Prince, though he lay in a dead sleep, began
to speak of Miss MacDonald with such praise, such settled
and devout regard, that Rupert got up from the heather and
went out into the still summer night, lest he pried too curiously
into sacred things. And as he went up and down the glen,
scenting the subtle odours that steal out at night-time, his
thoughts ran back to Lancashire. It seemed long since he had
roamed the moors in bygone summers, with just these keen,
warm scents about him, counting himself the scholar, aching
for Nance Demaine, dreaming high, foolish dreams of a day
that should come which would prove him fit to wear her favour.</p>

<p>And he was here, leaner and harder than of old, with a deed
or two to his credit. And he had learned a week ago, while
riding on the Prince&#8217;s business, that Lady Royd and Nance had
come to Edinburgh, intent on sharing the work of brave
women there who were aiding fugitives, by means fair or
crafty, to reach the shores of France. He knew that his
father and Maurice were safely overseas; and a sudden hope
flashed across the hard, unremitting purpose that had kept his
knees close about the saddle these last days. When the Prince
was secure, when these hazards were over&mdash;the hazards that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
had grown strangely pleasant&mdash;there might be leisure to return
to earlier dreams, to wake and find them all come true.</p>

<p>For an hour Rupert paced the glen, with gentler thoughts
for company than he had known since he first killed a man
at the siege of Windyhough. Then, with a shrug of the
shoulders, he remembered to-morrow and its needs, and went
back and settled himself to sleep; but he did not lie so near to
the Prince as before, lest he overhear him talk again of Miss
MacDonald.</p>

<p>The next day news came that the soldiery were out among
the hills again. The gallant head of Roderick MacKenzie,
who had earned a long respite for his Prince, had been taken
to London, and men who knew the Stuart had sworn that it
bore little likeness to him; and news had been sped north, by
riders killing a horse at every journey&#8217;s end, that the Prince
was still at large among the Highlands.</p>

<p>The Glenmoriston men were unmoved by this new trouble.
They explained, with careless humour, that their glen was
already so stripped of food as to be scarce worth living in;
and they went out with their guests into the unknown perils
waiting for them as if they went to revelry. And the Prince
learned afresh that a man, when his back is to the wall, had
best not seek friends among the sleek and prosperous, who
have cherished toys to love, but among the outlaws and the
driven folk who know the open road of life.</p>

<p>It was by aid of the Glenmoriston men, their knowledge
of the passes, that the fugitives came safe to Lochiel&#8217;s country
of Lochaber, that, after dangers so close-set as to be almost
laughable&mdash;so long the odds against them were&mdash;they reached
the shore of Loch Moidart and found a French privateer beating
about the coast. Those on board the ship were keeping an
anxious look-out toward both land and sea; they had been
advised that the Prince, with luck, might reach Moidart about
noon, and they knew, from sharp experience during their
voyage to the bay, that the enemy&#8217;s gunboats were thick as
flies about the Western Isles.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>It was an odd company that gathered on the strand while
the ship beat inshore with the half of a light, uncertain wind.
The Prince was there, Lochiel and Rupert, and a small band
of loyal gentry who had been in hiding round about their
homes. Yet a beggar in his rags and tatters might have joined
them and claimed free passage to the French coast, so far as
outward seeming went. Their clothes were made up of odds
and ends, begged or borrowed during the long retreat. All
were itching from the attacks of the big, lusty fleas that
abound along the loyal isles. The one sign that proved them
the Stuart&#8217;s gentlemen was a certain temperate ease of carriage,
a large disdain of circumstance, a security, gay and dominant,
in the faith that preferred beggarman&#8217;s rags to fine raiment
bought by treachery. They did not fear, did not regret,
though they were leaving all that meant home and the cosy
hearth.</p>

<p>The Prince, while the French ships were beating inshore,
took Lochiel aside. Through the wild campaign they had been
like twin brothers, these two, showing the same keen faith,
the like courage under hardship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lochiel, you know the country better than I. You&#8217;re bred
to your good land, while I was only born to it. You will tell
me where the Isle of Skye lies from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yonder,&#8221; said the other, pointing across the grey-blue haze
of summer seas.</p>

<p>And the Prince stood silent, thinking of the victory there
in Skye&mdash;the victory that had left him wearier than Culloden&#8217;s
sick defeat had done. And Lochiel, who had had his own
affairs to attend to lately, and had been aloof from gossip,
wondered as he saw the trouble in the other&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>The Prince turned at last. &#8220;Lochiel,&#8221; he said, with a tired
smile, &#8220;how does the Usurper&#8217;s proclamation run? Thirty
thousand pounds on my head&mdash;dead or alive! Well, alive or
dead, I wish this tattered body of mine were still in Skye&mdash;in
Skye, Lochiel, where I left the soul of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sad, your Highness&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>&#8220;Sad? Nay, I&#8217;ve waded deeper than mere sadness, like
the Skye mists out yonder. Well, we stand where we stand,
friend,&#8221; he added, with sharp return from dreams, &#8220;and the
ship is bringing to.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was still a little while before the boats were lowered
from the shore, and the Prince, pacing up and down the strand,
encountered Rupert. &#8220;A fine ending!&#8221; he said, with temperate
bitterness. &#8220;I landed in Lochaber from France with seven
gentlemen. I go back with a few more. This is the fruit of
your toil, Mr. Royd&mdash;and of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, &#8220;No, by your leave,&#8221; said Rupert. &#8220;Your Highness
has lit a fire that will never die&mdash;a fire of sheer devotion&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! the courtier speaks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert&#8217;s voice broke, harshly and without any warning. He
saw his Prince in evil case, when he should have been a conqueror.
He remembered the night rides, the faith, that had
had the crowning of the Stuart as their goal. &#8220;A broken
heart speaks&mdash;a heart broken in your service, sir,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s strength, his candid, deep simplicity, struck home
to the Prince, bringing a foolish mist about his eyes. &#8220;Your
love goes deep as that?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It goes deeper than my love of life, your Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then, after a silence, the other laid a strong kindly hand
on his shoulder. &#8220;You&#8217;ll go far and well for me, sir&mdash;but
put away that superstition of the broken heart. Believe me,
for I know&#8221;&mdash;he glanced across the misty stretch of sea that
divided him from Skye&mdash;&#8220;there are broken hopes, and broken
dreams, and disaster sobbing at one&#8217;s ears, but a man&mdash;a man,
sir, does not permit his heart to break. You and I&mdash;I think
we have our pride.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the boats grounded on the beach, the Prince waited
till his gentlemen got first aboard, and at last there were only
himself and Rupert left standing on the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will precede me, Mr. Royd. It is my privilege just
now to follow, not to lead,&#8221; said the Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness, I stay, by your leave.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>The mist had been creeping down from the tops for the past
hour, and now the light, outer fringe of it had reached the
water-line. The waiting boat lay in a haze of mystery; the
privateer beyond showed big and wraithlike, though a shrouded
sunlight still played on the crests of mimic waves. And the
Stuart and Rupert stood regarding each other gravely at this
last meeting for many weeks to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay?&#8221; echoed the Prince. &#8220;Sir, you have done so
much for me&mdash;and I looked to have your company during the
crossing; and, indeed, you must be ill of your exertions to
decline safety now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert glanced at the ship, then at the Stuart&#8217;s face. There
was temptation in the longing, to be near his Prince until
France was reached, but none in the thought of personal
safety. &#8220;I lay awake last night,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;and it grew
clear, somehow, that I was needed here in Scotland. There&#8217;s
the country round Edinburgh, your Highness&mdash;packed thick
with loyal men who are waiting their chance to find a ship
across to France&mdash;and I hold so many threads that Oliphant of
Muirhouse would have handled better, if he had lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; said the Prince, yielding to impulse after these
months of abnegation, &#8220;we&#8217;ll let our friends set sail without
us. These gentry did me service. You shall teach me to return
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness, it would ruin all! I can ride where you
cannot, because I&#8217;m of slight account&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you, too, have your mathematics, like the rest,&#8221; put in
the other wearily&mdash;&#8220;and all your sums add up to the one
total&mdash;that I must be denied the open hazard. I tell you, Mr.
Royd, it is no luxury to take ship across to France and leave
my friends in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mist was thickening, and Lochiel, growing anxious on
account of the delay, leaped ashore and came to where the
two were standing. And the Prince, returning to the prose of
things, knew that he must follow the road of tired retreat
mapped out for him since Derby.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>&#8220;Lochiel,&#8221; he said grimly, &#8220;I was planning an escape&mdash;from
safety. And your eyes accuse me, because my heart is
with this gentleman who chooses to stay in Scotland.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he told what Rupert had in mind; and Lochiel, for
all the urgency, halted a moment to appraise this lean, tranquil
man who met the call of destiny as if it were an invitation to
some pleasant supper-party.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was so Oliphant carried himself, Mr. Royd,&#8221; he said
gravely. &#8220;God knows I wish you well.&#8221;</p>

<p>They parted. And Rupert watched their boat reach the privateer,
watched the ship&#8217;s bulk glide huge and ghostly into the
mists. He was hard and zealous, had chosen his road deliberately;
but he was human, too, and a sense of utter loneliness
crept over him. The Cause was lost. Many of his friends
would not tread French or Scottish ground again, because the
soil lay over them. He had not tasted food that day, and
the mist seemed to be soaking into the bones of him. And
loyalty, that had brought him to this pass, showed like a dim,
receding star which mocked him as a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp might
do.</p>

<p>For all that, he was born and bred a Royd, and the discipline
of many months was on his side. And, little by little, he regained
that steadiness of soul&mdash;not to be counterfeited or replaced
by any other joy&mdash;which comes to the man whose back
is to the wall, with a mob of dangers assaulting him in front.</p>

<p>The Glenmoriston men had been offered their chance of a
passage to France with the Prince, but had declined it, preferring
their own country and the dangerous life that had grown
second nature to them. And Rupert, knowing the glen to
which they had ridden after speeding the Stuart forward,
waited till the mists had lifted a little and found his way to
them.</p>

<p>They crossed themselves when he appeared among them as
they sat on the slope of the brae, cooking the midday meal;
but when he proved himself no ghost and explained the reason
of his coming, and his need to be set on the way to Edinburgh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
they warmed afresh to his view of that difficult business named
life. He shared their meal, and afterwards one of their number,
Hector, by name, led him out along the first stage of his
journey south.</p>

<p>The mists had cleared by this time, leaving the braesides russet
where the sun swept the autumn brackens, but the mood
they bring to Highlandmen was strong on Rupert&#8217;s guide.
Hector could find no joy in life, no talk to ease the going. Instead,
he fell into a low, mournful chant; and the words of it
were not calculated to raise drooping spirits:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;But I have seen a dreary dream</div>
<div class="indent">Beyond the Isle o&#8217; Skye,</div>
<div class="verse">I saw a dead man won the fight.</div>
<div class="indent">And I think that man was I.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>A little chill crossed Rupert&#8217;s courage, as if a touch of east
wind had come from the heart of the warm skies. He had
seen many dreary dreams of late; had fared beyond the Isle
o&#8217; Skye; what if Hector were &#8220;seeing far,&#8221; and this dirge
were an omen of the coming days? And then he laughed, because
in the dangerous tracks men make their own omens or
disdain them altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re near the truth, Hector,&#8221; he broke in; &#8220;but it&#8217;s
only a half-dead man. There&#8217;s life yet in him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Hector glowered at him; for the Highland folk, when
they are hugging sadness close, cherish it as a mother does
her first-born babe. For all that, he brought Rupert safely,
after three days&#8217; marching, to the next post of his journey, and
passed him on to certain outlaws whose country lay farther
south; and by this sort of help, after good and evil weather
and some mischances by the way, Rupert came at last to
Edinburgh and reached the house where he knew that Lady
Royd and Nance were lodging.</p>

<p>The house lay very near to Holyrood; and as he went down
the street Rupert halted for a while, forgetful of his errand.
The tenderest moon that ever lit a troubled world looked down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
on this palace of departed glories. The grey pile was mellowed,
transfigured by some light o&#8217; dreams. It was as if the
night knew all about the Stuarts who would haunt Holyrood
so long as its walls stood; knew their haplessness, their charm,
their steadfast hold on the fine, unthrifty faith they held; knew
the answer that some of them, who had gone before, had
found in the hereafter that does not weigh with the shopkeepers&#8217;
scales.</p>

<p>There is a soul in such walls as Holyrood&#8217;s, and Rupert
stood as if he held communion with a friend whose sympathies
ran step by step with his. Here Mary Stuart had stood
alone, a queen in name, facing the barbarous, lewd nobles
who were, by title of mere courtesy, her gentlemen. Here
she had seen Rizzio hurried down the twisting stair, had
supped with her fool-husband, Darnley. From here she had
gone out, the queen of hearts and tragedy, to that long exile
which was to end at Fotheringay.</p>

<p>Here, too, the Prince had kept high state, a year ago, and
all Edinburgh had flocked to dance a Stuart measure. He
came fresh from his first battle, crowned with victory and
charm of person; and the clans were rising fast; and hope
shone bright toward London and the crown.</p>

<p>Rupert looked at the grey pile and felt all this, as one
listens to the silence of a friend who does not need to speak.
And then a drift of cloud came across the moon, and Holyrood
lay wan and grey. It was as if a sudden gust had quenched
all the candles that had lit the ballroom here when the yellow-haired
laddie came dancing south.</p>

<p>And still the fugitive tarried. He had been used so long
to night roads and the constant peril that this dim light, and
the wind piping at his ear, pleased him more than any blaze
of candles and lilt of dance-music. Deep knowledge came to
him, bred of the hazards that had made him hard and lean.
He sorrowed no more for Derby and Culloden; his present
thirst and hunger went by him, as things of slight account;
for he remembered the long months of hiding, the intimacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
he had been privileged to share with Prince Charles Edward.
There had been no glamour of the dance, no pomp, about these
journeyings through the Highlands; there had been no swift,
eager challenge and applause from ladies&#8217; eyes; and yet Rupert
had tested, as few had done, the fine edge and temper of
the Stuart charm.</p>

<p>Here, under the shadow of grey Holyrood, he loitered to
recall their wayfaring together. There had been winter journeyings
through incessant rain, or snow, or winds that raved
down mountain passes; there had been summer travels through
the heather, with the sun beating pitilessly on them, over the
stark length of moors that had none but brackish water and
no shade. They had slept o&#8217; nights with danger for a pillow
and the raw wind for coverlet. And through it all the Prince
had shown a brave, unanswerable front to the sickness of
defeat, the hiding when he longed for action. If food and
drink were scarce, he sang old clan songs or recalled light jests
and stories that had once roused the French Court to laughter.
If danger pressed so closely from all four quarters of the
hill that escape seemed hopeless, his cheeriness infected those
about him with a courage finer than their own.</p>

<p>Looking back on these days, Rupert knew that no ball at
Holyrood here, no triumph-march to London, could have
proved the Stuart as those Highland journeyings had done.
The Prince and he had learned the way of gain in loss, and
with it the gaiety that amazes weaker men.</p>

<p>From Holyrood&mdash;the moon free of clouds and the grey walls
finding faith again&mdash;a friendly message came to him. He
caught the Stuart glamour up&mdash;the true, abiding glamour that
does not yield to this world&#8217;s limitations. What he had read
in the library at Windyhough was now a triumph-song that
he had found voice to sing.</p>

<p>He came to the house where Lady Royd was lodging, and
knocked at the door; and presently a trim Scots lassie opened
to him, and saw him standing there in the moonlight of the
street, his face haggard, his clothes, made up of borrowed odds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
and ends, suggesting disrepute. She tried to close the door
in his face; but Rupert had anticipated this, and pushed his
way inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Miss Demaine in the house?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The maid recovered a little of her courage and her native
tartness. &#8220;She is, forbye. Have you come buying old claes,
or are you looking just for a chance to steal siller from the
hoose?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert caught at the help she gave him. &#8220;There&#8217;s the quick
wit ye have, my lass,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now, you&#8217;ll not be &#8216;my lassing&#8217; me! I&#8217;ll bid ye keep
your station, as I keep mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, my dear, go up to your mistress&mdash;the young
mistress, I mean&mdash;and tell her there&#8217;s a pedlar wanting her&mdash;a
pedlar from the hills of Lancashire. Tell her he comes
<i>buying and selling white favours</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re just one of us,&#8221; said the maid, with surprising
change of front. Then, her Scots caution getting the better
of her again, &#8220;Your voice is o&#8217; the gentry-folk,&#8221; she added,
&#8220;but you&#8217;re a queer body i&#8217; your claes. How should I know
what you&#8217;d be stealing while I ran up to tell the mistress?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert, for answer, closed and barred the door behind him,
and pointed up the stair. And then the maid, by the masterful,
quiet way of him, knew that he came peddling honesty.</p>

<p>And by and by Nance came down, guessing who had come,
because twice during the past month Rupert had sent word to
her by messengers encountered haphazard in the Highland
country.</p>

<p>At the stairfoot she halted, and never saw what clothes he
wore. She looked only at his hard, tired face, at the straight
carriage of him, as if he stood on parade. And, without her
knowing it, or caring either way, a welcome, frank and luminous,
brought a sudden beauty to the face that had been magical
enough to him in the far-off Lancashire days.</p>

<p>The warmth of the lighted hall, the sense of courage and
well-being that Nance had always brought him, were in sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
contrast with the night and the ceaseless peril out of doors.
He went to her, and took her two hands, and would not be
done with reading what her eyes had to tell him. There could
be no doubting what had come to them&mdash;the love deep, and
to the death, and loyal; the love, not to be bought or counterfeited,
that touches common things with radiance.</p>

<p>Rupert was giddy with it all. He had only to stoop and
claim her, without question asked or answered. And yet he
would not. He fought against this sudden warmth that
tempted him to forget his friends&mdash;those driven comrades
who trusted him to see them safely on board ship to the French
coast. He put Nance away, as a courtier might who fears to
hurt his queen, and only the strength of him redeemed his
ludicrous and muddied clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not proved yet?&#8221; said Nance, with a gentle laugh
of raillery and comradeship. &#8220;And yet the men who come
in from the Highlands&mdash;the men we have helped to safety,
Lady Royd and I&mdash;bring another tale of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good women and bad are keen to play the temptress when
they see a man hard set by the peril of his own wind-driven,
eager heart; for Eve dies hard in any woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are others,&#8221; he said stubbornly&mdash;&#8220;loyal men who
trust me to bring them into Edinburgh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scruples?&#8221; She mocked him daintily. &#8220;Women are not
won by scruples.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her with the disarming, boyish smile that she
remembered from old days&mdash;the smile which hid a purpose
hard as steel. &#8220;Then women must be lost, Nance,&#8221; he answered
suavely.</p>

<p>Nance looked at him. He had changed since the days when
her least whim had swayed him more than did the giving of
her whole heart now. He was steady and unyielding, like a
rock against which the winds beat idly. And suddenly a
loneliness came over her, a wild impatience of men&#8217;s outlook.
She recalled the day at Windyhough, just after Sir Jasper had
ridden out, when Lady Royd had complained that honour was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
more to a man than wife-love and his home&#8217;s need of him.
She remembered how, with a girl&#8217;s untutored zeal, she had
blamed Sir Jasper&#8217;s wife because she could not realise the
high romance of it. But now she understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;You rode out to prove yourself&mdash;for my sake and the
Cause?&#8221; she said, with cool disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Nance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you found&mdash;adventure. And your name is one to
kindle hero-worship wherever loyal fugitives meet and speak
of you. Oh, you shall have your due, Rupert! But in the
doing of it the hard endeavour grew dear in itself&mdash;dearer than
life, than&mdash;than little Nance Demaine, for whose sake you got
to horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>He flushed, knowing she spoke truth; and he stood at bay,
ashamed of what should have been his pride. And then he returned,
by habit, to the mood taught him by night-riding and
the over-arching skies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men love that way,&#8221; he said bluntly.</p>

<p>Nance was twisting and untwisting the kerchief she held
between her capable, strong fingers. She had not guessed till
now the bitterness of tongue she could command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, my dear; we learned it together, did we not, in
the library at Windyhough? There was a book of Richard
Lovelace, his poems, and he was very graceful when he bade
his wife farewell:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;&#8216;I could not love thee, dear, so much</div>
<div class="indent2">Loved I not honour more.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And honour took him to the open&mdash;to the rousing hunt&mdash;and
his wife stayed on at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert, unskilled in the lore that has tempted many fools
afield, was dismayed by the attack. In his simplicity, he had
looked for praise when he put temptation by him and asked
only for a God-speed till the road of his plain duty was ended
and he was free to claim her. He did not know&mdash;how should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
he?&mdash;that women love best the gifts that never reach their
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nance,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what ails you women? It was so at
Windyhough, when the Loyal Meet rode out, and mother
cried as if they&#8217;d found dishonour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails us?&#8221; She was not bitter now, but helpless, and
her eyes were thick with tears. &#8220;Our birthright ails us.
We&#8217;re like children crying in the dark, and the night&#8217;s lonely
round us, and we are far from home. And the strong hand
comes to us, and we cast it off, because we need its strength.
And then we go crying in the dark again, and wonder why
God made us so. And&mdash;and that is what ails us,&#8221; she added,
with a flash of sharp, defiant humour. And her eyes clouded
suddenly. &#8220;I&mdash;I have lost a father to the Cause. It is hard
to be brave these days, Rupert.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then he looked neither before nor after, but took the
straight way and the ready with her. And by and by the
yapping of a pampered dog broke the silence of the house,
and Lady Royd&#8217;s voice sounded, low and querulous, from the
stairhead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nance, where are you? Poor Fido is not well&mdash;not well
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the moment Rupert believed that he was home at
Windyhough again. Fido&#8217;s bark, the need paramount that his
wants must be served at once, were like old days.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have not told her you are here,&#8221; said Nance. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
run up and break the news.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Rupert came into the parlour up above, Fido, true to
old habit, ran yapping round him, and bit his riding-boots; for
he hated men, because they knew him for a lap-dog. And,
after the din had died down a little, Rupert stepped to his
mother&#8217;s side, and stooped to kiss her hand. And she looked
him up and down; and the motherhood in her was keen
and proved, but she could forego old habits as little as could
Fido.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear heart, what clothes to wear in Edinburgh!&#8221; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s as well you&#8217;re not known in the town for a
Royd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s as well, mother,&#8221; he answered dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are thinner than you were, Rupert, and straighter in
the shoulders, and&mdash;and many things have happened to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I rode out for happenings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you&#8217;re so like your father; and they tell me what
you&#8217;ve done&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, mother?&#8221; he broke in. &#8220;There are gentlemen
of the Prince&#8217;s who would not be safe in France to-day without
your help&mdash;yours and Nance&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, my dear, you fatigue me! I have done so little.
It grew dull in Lancashire, waiting for news of your father.
It was all so simple&mdash;Fido, my sweet, you will not bark at
Rupert; he&#8217;s a friend&mdash;and then I had my own fortune, you
see, apart from Windyhough, and one must spend money
somehow, must one not? So I began playing at ships&mdash;just
like a child gone back to the nursery&mdash;and Nance here was as
big a baby as myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Rupert had changed, so had Lady Royd. There was no
faded prettiness now about her face, but there were lines of
beauty. Behind her light handling of these past weeks in
Edinburgh there was a record of sleepless nights, of harassed
days, of discomfort and peril undertaken willingly. She had
spent money in providing means of passage for the exiles;
but she had spent herself, too, in ceaseless stratagem and
watchfulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all so piquant,&#8221; she went on, in the old, indolent
tone. &#8220;So many gallant men supped here, Rupert, before
taking boat. And they brought each his tale of battle in the
hills. And their disguises were so odd, almost as odd as the
clothes you&#8217;re wearing now, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince&#8217;s were little better when I last saw him,&#8221;
laughed the other.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, now, you will sit down beside me&mdash;here&mdash;and Nance
shall sit there, like Desdemona listening to Othello. And you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
will tell us of the Prince. You were very near his person during
the Highland flight, they tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Rupert, because he had that one night&#8217;s leisure at command,
forgot his own perils in telling of the Stuart&#8217;s. He had
no art of narrative, except the soldier&#8217;s plain telling of what
chanced; but, step by step, he led them through the broken
days, talking seldom of himself, but constantly of Prince
Charles Edward, until the bare record of their wanderings became
a lively and abiding tribute to the Stuart&#8217;s strength.
And when he had done Lady Royd was crying softly, while
Nance felt a strange loyalty play round her like a windy night
about the moors of Lancashire.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was like that!&#8221; said Lady Royd at last. &#8220;He was
like that, while, God forgive me! I was picturing him all the
while in love-locks, dancing a minuet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sword-dance is better known, mother, where we have
been,&#8221; said Rupert, with pleasant irony.</p>

<p>Late that night, when Nance had left them together for a
while, Lady Royd came and laid a hand on her son&#8217;s arm.
&#8220;You have done enough,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh, I know! There
are still many broken men, waiting for a passage. They must
take their chance, Rupert. Your father was not ashamed to
cross to France, with my help.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put an arm about her, for he had learned tenderness in
a hard school. &#8220;Mother, he was not ashamed, because his
work was done here. Mine is not. What Oliphant knew of
the byways&mdash;what the last months have taught me&mdash;I cannot
take the knowledge with me, to rust in France. I am pledged
to these gentry of the Prince&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall go on playing at ships here&mdash;till you come
to ask a passage.&#8221;</p>

<p>And her face was resolute and proud, as if this son of hers
had returned a conqueror.</p>

<p>The next day, after nightfall, Rupert went out again, through
Edinburgh&#8217;s moonlit streets, toward the northern hills and the
perils that he coveted. And just before he went Nance Demaine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
came down into the hall, and stood beside him in the
gusty candlelight. Old days and new were tangled in her
mind; she was aware only of a great heart-sickness and trouble,
so that she did not halt to ask herself if it were maidenly or
prudent to come down for another long good-bye. In some
muddled way she remembered Will Underwood, his debonair
and easy claiming of her kerchief, remembered their meeting
on the heath, and afterwards Will lying in the courtyard at
Windyhough, his body tortured by a gaping wound. She had
given him her kerchief then for pity, and now Rupert was going
out without claiming the token she would have given him
for love. Rupert seemed oddly forgetful of little things these
days, she told herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you not wear my favour&mdash;for luck?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>And then, giving no time for answer, she began feverishly
to knot her kerchief into a white cockade; and then again she
thought better of it, and untied the blue scarf that was her
girdle, and snipped a piece from it with the scissors hanging
at her waist.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the dear Madonna&#8217;s colour; and I think you ride for
faith,&#8221; she said, with a child&#8217;s simplicity. &#8220;Rupert, I do not
know how or why, but I let you go very willingly. I did not
understand until to-night how&mdash;how big a man&#8217;s love for a
woman is.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were not easy days that followed. Rupert was among
the Midlothian hills&mdash;farther afield sometimes&mdash;snatching sleep
and food when he could, shepherding the broken gentry, leaving
nothing undone that a man&#8217;s strength and single purpose
could accomplish. And in the house near Holyrood Lady
Royd and Nance were helping the fugitives he sped forward to
get on shipboard. And ever, as they plied this trade of separation
under peril, a knowledge and a trust went up and down
between Edinburgh and the northern hills&mdash;a trust that did
not go on horseback or on foot, because its wings were
stretched for flight above ground.</p>

<p>And near the year&#8217;s end, with an easterly haar that made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
town desolate, the last fugitive came to the house that lay
near Holyrood. He should have been spent with well-doing,
foot-sore and saddle-sore with journeyings among the hills;
but, instead he carried himself as if he had found abundant
health.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done my work, mother,&#8221; he said, stooping to Lady
Royd&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as well, my dear. Nance and I were nearly tired of
playing at ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night they got aboard at Leith; and, after a contrary
and troubled crossing, they came into harbour on the French
coast. The night was soft and pleasant, like the promises
that France had made the Stuart&mdash;the promises made and
broken a score of times before ever the Prince landed in the
Western Isles. A full moon was making a track of amethyst
and gold across the gentle seas, and a faint, salt breeze was
blowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you content?&#8221; asked Nance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Content? My dear, what else?&#8221;</p>

<p>And yet she saw his glance rove out across the moonlit track
that led to England; and a jealous trouble, light as the sea-breeze,
crossed her happiness; and she conquered it, because
she had learned in Edinburgh the way of a man&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re dreaming of the next Rising?&#8221; she said, with a
low, tranquil laugh. &#8220;I shall forgive you&mdash;so long as you
let me share your dreams.&#8221;</p>
